Assembling a list of works is a long overdue duty. 

* accessibility tests, learnt things
* overall very happy with tech stack
* for the frst tme happy with much flexbox use
* sat in the roof top during corona crisis a lot (because it is outdoors but no infection risk) thats why I ended up with the sky backgrounds
* learnt new things eg ‘sky’ gradient background negative margin to make the footer a skyline that ‘sticks to the floor’
* own Handschrift failed so far
* 1st farbschema + dark theme
* open graph content is annoying
* the filtering works with jquery and as a future project I might learn proper java script
