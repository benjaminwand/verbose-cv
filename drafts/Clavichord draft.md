# Clavichord

#### how I got there
* my musical things from childhoo were forgotten
* 2015 I went to Tag der offenen Tür @Philharmonie (Ostern?) where one of the items of interest was Klangskulptur for children, with wood, strings and Metalldose Sound boards, it could get tunes by a tuning hammer and I tuned it differently a few times. 
* this reminded me that we had a broken piano which was supposed to be impossible to tune / Klavier Stimmen versuchen 2015-4-13 / and so I thought why not and bought a tuning hammer and tuned the piano as well as I could. It was fun but indeed it was impossible to tune.
* Next, I wanted to learn more about piano mechanics and went  2015-04-21 Musikinstrumete Museum, and saw clavichords for the fist time : so cute! and I had a very immediate and strong ‘cute’ reaction, as if they were kittens but much stronger. The simplicity of it was intriguing and I very much wanted to build one.
