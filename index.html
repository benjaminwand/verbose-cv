      <h1>Benjamin Wand - Verbose CV</h1>

      <p class="introduction">
        As a generalist and prototyper, I'm publishing very different things on
        various channels and since I ever was asked about it I'm struggeling
        with what should be on my cv. Obviously the later depends on the
        occasion but it might be nice having a place where it comes together,
        for myself and for next time someone asks me "So, what do you do?"
        <br />
        This list can be seen as an electronic Scanners Daybook,
        <a href="https://gostrengths.com/refuse-to-choose/">
          as Barbara calls it</a
        >, and the dream would be that I'll never again have to assemble a cv
        because people will be satisfied with this list.
        <br />
        It will be substantial work to achive that, for now this page is very
        incomplete. My goal is having a complete-ish 2020 soon and then add
        current things constantly and add older things when I feel like it. If
        you know me and there is a thing I should totally mention here -

          <p class="description">
            In 2019 I started watching a data visualisation course and other
            things that included
            <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a> and
            <a href="https://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a> and never did
            anything with that knowledge. But now we have the corona-crisis and
            since I stare at data multiple times a day anyway, I thought I might
            as well do something with it. Turns out, with
            <a href="https://flourish.studio">flourish</a> the chart-making is
            very easy once one has cleaned the data. I used the dataset from
            <a href="github.com/CSSEGISandData">Johns Hopkins</a>, and will
            update it every now and then.

          <p class="description">
            At the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 related stay-home-order I was
            looking for something to engage in other than siting on the couch.
            And since I am somewhat decently able to sew (which was actually my
            first job as a young adult), it was obvious that sewing masks could
            be a thing.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            I found a charity that would happily take masks from me,
            <a href="http://www.delatorre-stiftung.de"
              >Jenna de la Torre Stiftung</a
            >, who does basic medical service for homeless people.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            But after sewing a few masks, I remembered that I actually donâ€™t
            like sewing and felt the need to entertain myself intellctually. It
            was an incentive to optimize things, what would be the best
            combination of aspects of self-made face masks for sewing and use? I
            could use my knowledge about the process of sewing and pros and cons
            regarding face mask features and my overall good understanding of
            three-dimensional things to to judge what kind of mask has the over
            all least disadvantages.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            And once I was there I set up a github pages site and
            <a
              href="https://benjaminwand.github.io/Cotton-Mask/instructions/BenjaminW-2.html"
              >publish my instruction.</a
            >
            The website also includes an earlier mask type of mine and a mask
            sewing instruction of
            <a href="https://twitter.com/D_70WN">D_70WN</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            Obviously what is good and what isn't is subjectice, other people
            decided similar questions differently, based on their
            mask-wearing-preferences, aesthetic preferences and sewing-process
            likes and dislikes. I had conversations with other people who sew
            face masks and we assembled a
            <a href="https://benjaminwand.github.io/Cotton-Mask/tabelle.html"
              >table of aspects of self-made face masks and their pros and
              cons.</a
            >
            Except for sewing-laziness the motivation for my decisions were that
            I wanted a robust and no-fuss mask that I could go jogging with and
            I wanted to give others masks of a similar standard. A difference
            though was that the Jenny-de-la-Torre-Stiftung wanted masks without
            threads for easier cleaning and so they got masks without threads.
