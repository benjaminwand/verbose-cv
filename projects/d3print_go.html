        <p>
          February 2021 a friend wanted to play games with me and I suggested
          playing go. His birthday was comming up and since he was a beginner
          and I didn't play go in over ten years, I made him a game with 9x9 and
          13x13 fields for his birthday. <br />
          I used drawing pins as stones to keep the game tiny and so that his
          cats can't ruin the game.

        <h3>Printing the pattern onto the surface</h3>
        <p>
          One technique I used for the first time during this project was
          printing an image onto the side of the printed part that sits on the
          print bed. One prints the image at one layer height and leaves it on
          the print bed while printing the actual object onto it. I've
          documented it in the video below.

        <h3>Technical difficulties</h3>
        <p>
          When printing the go board in one piece I experienced problems with
          warping. I ended up using adhesives and printed both sides separately
          and glued them together.
        </p>
        <h3>More models</h3>
        <p>
          After wrapping the gift I had further ideas and wrote two more files,
          where the boards have drawers for the stones, one of which is supposed
          to be printed in one piece and the other is specifically designed to
          be glued together, see the image below.
          <br />
          19x19 games are being programmed too.
