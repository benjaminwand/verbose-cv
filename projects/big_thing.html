      <h2>The project</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          I wrote a first prototype for the project of Kerry Williams from
          Alaska who would like to build large objects, like kayaks, from 3d
          printed puzzle pieces, so, now that more and more people have access
          to 3d printers, more people have the chance to build large things on
          their own. <br />
          The first prototype is a sphere shaped puzzle that I wrote in
          <a href="https://openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a> and the pieces are
          hexagons and pentagons, like a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron"
            >soccer ball / truncated icosahedron</a
          >. The files are
          <a
            href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/OpenScad-random/tree/main/items/round_puzzles"
            >on GitHub</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/615424-sphere-puzzle/files"
            >on Printables</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>I went for a truncated icosahedron because</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            it is mathematically figured out, therefore I don't need to worry
            about
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation"
              >tessellation</a
            >
            to begin with, and
          </li>
          <li>
            I find beneficial, or a good example, that it is made of hexagons
            and pentagons because that provides a favorable ratio of edge length
            versus surface covered. (More about that in the video
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY"
              >Hexagons are the Bestagons</a
            >.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The maths of the truncated icosahedron is taken from
          <a
            href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/430670-truncated-icosahedron-rounded-soccer-form"
            >this printable</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see on the image with the blue ball, the pieces have an
          edge inside in order to ease the maneuvering of the pieces against
          each other and to keep the last piece from falling inside of the ball.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tilted dovetail is something I haven't seen before, so maybe I've
          invented it.

      <h2>The code</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Apart from moving around pentagons and hexagons, the code does this:
          call one piece, and cut away the previous pieces. This way it is made
          sure that the pieces fit neatly into each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data for each piece looks like that:
        </p>
        <pre> <code class="OpenSCAD">rotate([hh,0,120]) rotate([hh,0,60])
  piece(6, 18, [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], $gap); </code></pre>
        <p>
          and the <code>[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]</code> part encodes which sides are
          dovetailed or initially flat. <br />
          The dovetailed pieces 'bite' into the flat peaces, resulting in two
          pieces that fit together.
        </p>

        <pre> <code class="OpenSCAD">for (i = interval) { // interval = which pieces
  intersection(){
    globe();         // the sphere
    difference(){
      let($gap = 0) children(i);
      if (i > 0) for (k = [0:i-1])
        let($gap = gap) children(k);
    };
  };
}; </code></pre>
        <p>
          The <code>$gap</code> makes sure that the pieces can get disassembled
          again.
        </p>
