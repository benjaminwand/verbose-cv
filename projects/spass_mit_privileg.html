      <h2>Setting</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          This performance was part of a mandatory
          <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/kunst/studium-lehre#c2070082"
            >seminar "Flüchtige Räume"
          </a>
          by
          <a href="http://www.stefanie-buerkle.de">professor Stefanie Bürkle</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by
          <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/964"
            >Marina Abramović</a
          >, I sat at a table in
          <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Nationalgalerie"
            >Neue Nationalgalerie</a
          >
          labeled 'Spaß mit Privileg', and asked those who sat down with me "How
          do you enjoy your privilege?" <br />
          Since documentation was required, I took hand written notes. At the
          times when no-one sat with me, I wrote down my stream of thoughts.

      <h2>Two very different days</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          June 19th I sat in the entrance hall of Neue Nationalgalerie in front
          of the
          <a href="https://www.smb.museum/ausstellungen/detail/andy-warhol/"
            >Andy Warhol exhibition</a
          >
          and was frequently asked organisatorial matters like where the toilets
          are. The museum curator responsible for the seminar took this as
          feedback that the signage doesn't work, which is in fact an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          June 20th I was in
          <a
            href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skulpturenpark_der_Neuen_Nationalgalerie_und_Skulpturen_am_Kulturforum#/media/Datei:Neue_Nationalgalerie_Sculpture_Garden.jpg"
            >the garden</a
          >, where the guests had already figured out those things. The garden
          had a special meaning for the project: I had the idea in the garden,
          where, after several unsuccessful attempts due to wrong weather, I
          felt very privileged to have access to. The sun provided a time-lapse
          version of the burden of Abramovićs long sessions: the sunscreen did
          hold but by the end of the day I had a mild case of sun stroke and
          could watch myself having difficulties to form cohesive sentences.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Findings</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Probably the guest I felt most emotional about was an Ukrainian man
          around age 30 who replied: "Now I am here, this is my privilege. But
          in two weeks I have to go back to Ukraine again." I wished him to
          survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having someone listening to them seemed to impress several guests
          deeply. Some, especially older women, thanked me warmly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had two artist guests, and the second gave me an 'The Artist is
          Present' moment too. Unfortunately I didn't ask her for her name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people replied "Which privilege?", there were the reflected who
          had "he sun is shining, I can travel and see exhibitions" kinds of
          answers, and some mentioned material goods, eg "with my silver
          Lufthansa card I can travel with two bags and don't need to wait in
          line".
          <br />
          Many older people made the impression that they were just happy to be
          offered a chair to sit on. Two made little drawings. Unfortunately for
          the museum curators who hoped for free customer survey data from me,
          nobody referred to Neue Nationalgalerie in their tales.
        </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          In the end, it felt too pedagogical to do such works often. For
          instance the last two guests were two Chinese female students where it
          went like this: <br />
          me: "How do you enjoy your privilege?",<br />
          they: "We are Asian women, we can't be privileged",<br />
          me (irritated with approaching sun stroke and needing to call it a
          day): "But you are in a museum. Volkswagen pays so you can look at
          famous art, isn't that something?"<br />
          They weren't convinced. Fifteen minutes later they came back. They had
          figured out that they are in fact privileged. Due to studying in
          Germany, they have more free time and can travel more than if they
          would study in China.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not up for such interactions. But then, it was a first step at
          learning to talk with strangers about their social status, which is a
          interesting and important thing to learn. And the older ladies
          thankfulness was interesting and rewarding.
