      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>A list was long overdue</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          "Assembling a list of works" is a thing I should have been doing since
          a long time. Not doing it made me feel guilty in a similar way as not
          "learning to write code", which deserves its own article and obviously
          meanwhile I do write code.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why is it so important and so charged with guilty feelings? <br />
          When introducing to people, it is common to be asked 'So, what do you
          do?', and this is not only a convention but for many people it seems
          to be inevitable knowing, they can't live without. And since I was
          decreasingly able to answer it throughout the years, the question
          became more and more horrible as well in party-like situations as in
          professional ones. It seems like I can either live alone on a hill and
          grow roses or learn to answer the dreaded 'So, what do you do?'
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="columns"></section>
      <h3>But why is it so hard?</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          In short: I do very many things and that is not how most people live
          and there is a lack of role models for 'doing so many things' in our
          nowadays western culture.<br />
          It wasn't always like that.
        </p>
        <p class="draft">
          I think the main reasons are that I'm so at home with beginnings, and
          overall communication challenges. I love exploring new territory and
          as soon as I've figured out a thing well enough I'll likely drop it
          and do a new shiny thing and the 'drop it' is quite thorough, chances
          are that I'm so done with it that I'm annoyed with people still
          believing I'm the same person as when I was on the last project.
          <br />
          appreciating (all) works matters <br />
          then I even can't be bothered with conversations about it anymore, yet
          with pride. But most people are proud about their works, <br />
          writing about concrete projects: scanner daybook <br />
          making it easier thought: making youtube videos about the projects of
          the last half year
          <br />
          the bar chart and the mask site were low hanging fruits but now it
          starts being more demanding remembering and collecting information
          about projects. I hope this will teach me to write them soon when they
          are still fresh
        </p>

      <h3>Strategies</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          I was postponing writing a list of works for years and obviously the
          longer I waited the more burdensome the task became. How could I make
          it lightweight? Non-lightweight but rewarding approaches were found in
          Barbara Shers
          <a href="https://gostrengths.com/refuse-to-choose/"
            >'Refuse to Choose'</a
          >, who preaches showing off all the things in one way or another. I
          wrote 'Scanner Daybook' entries for a couple of projects and found
          that very rewarding, and I was looking for more public ways to show
          all the random but significant things I'm doing. The next idea was
          making a youtube video every few months and as was collecting projects
          from the first quarter of 2020 I realized that that won't work either
          because it can't be made in an incremental way and collecting a
          complete quarter of a year seemed a too high hurdle. And then I
          published things on websites in spring 2020 and it became obvious to
          make it as a webpage.

          As a generalist and prototyper, I do/create very different things, and
          publish very different things on various platforms. And since I can
          remember, I'm struggling to answer the dreaded 'So, what do you do?'
          What belongs on a cv depends on the occasion, but here I'm trying to
          create a home for all the not insignificant other things, that usually
          don't end up on a cv.

          Achiving this will be a lot of work. My goal is having a complete-ish
          2020 soon and then add current things constantly and older things when
          I feel like it. If you know me and there is a thing that should
          totally get an article here -

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Since it was outdoors and without Covid-19 infection risk, I spent
          much time during stay-home-order on the roof top. And so it happened
          that I wrote the basic structure of this website with the sky as a
          background, and the sky made it into the design as well. <br />
          Obviously this is not a very conceptually driven design choice but
          since this is my first screen design I'm allowing myself to be
          playful. Beginning playfully is always nice.

        <p class="draft">
          it is a learning project. <br />
          * accessibility tests, learnt things <br />
          * overall very happy with tech stack<br />
          * for the first time happy with much flexbox use<br />
          * learnt new things eg ‘sky’ gradient background negative margin to
          make the footer a skyline that ‘sticks to the floor’<br />
          * own Handschrift failed so far<br />
          * 1st color scheme + dark theme<br />
          * open graph content is annoying<br />
          * the filtering works with jQuery and as a future project I might
          learn proper java script <br />

      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          * open graph content is annoying<br />
          * writing is super nice <br />
          more feedback/interaction would be nice not sure whethr I shall write
          more article on social media
