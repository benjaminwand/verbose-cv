        This Website
      </h1>
      <p class="date">May - September 2020</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>A list was long overdue</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          "Assembling a list of works" is a thing I should have been doing since
          a long time. Not doing it made me feel guilty in a similar way as not
          "learning to write code", which deserves its own article and obviously
          meanwhile I do write code.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why is it so important and so charged with guilty feelings? <br />
          When introducing to people, it is common to be asked 'So, what do you
          do?', and this is not only a convention but for many people it seems
          to be inevitable knowing, they can't live without. And since I was
          decreasingly able to answer it throughout the years, the question
          became more and more horrible as well in party-like situations as in
          professional ones. It seems like I can either live alone on a hill and
          grow roses or learn to answer the dreaded 'So, what do you do?'
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="columns"></section>
      <h3>But why is it so hard?</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Most people are proud of their works and it is expected to identify
          with past works. For instance: authors are expected to take pride in
          their books and to promote books they wrote in the past. But this is
          not how it works for me. I do very different things and I very much
          enjoy starting new things, and that is not how most people live and
          there is a lack of role models for 'doing so many things' in our
          nowadays western culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't always like that, nobody complained about Leonardo DaVinci
          doing many different things, and so one term for this special human
          operating system is 'Renaissance person', other terms are
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">Polymath</a>,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o29KOV0jYRM">Scanner</a> and
          <a
            href="https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare"
            >Multipotentialite</a
          >. So yes, there are terms and self-help-literature, which is better
          than nothing, but the existence of people who do many unconnected
          things is still not well enough established in our culture that
          mentioning one of the terms above would be a satisfying answer for
          most peoples ‘So, what do you do?’.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way out of this would be having a party-answer, similarly to some
          people with complicated or foreign names having a ’Starbugs name’. But
          my life isn't a party-answer and I don’t want to encourage people to
          treat me, or anybody else, as such. Complexity is beautiful. I would
          like the people around me to acknowledge my complexity as they live
          along with me and benefit from the many things I know about
          practically or theoretically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another problem with settling for a party-answer is that I didn’t run
          into a party-answer that includes having a fast growth trajectory as a
          main point. I love exploring new territory and as soon as I've figured
          out a thing well enough I'll likely drop it and do a new shiny thing,
          and the 'drop it' is quite thorough, chances are that I'm so done with
          it that I'm annoyed with people still believing I'm the same person as
          when I was on the last project.
        </p>

      <h3>And what can be won!</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Apart from displaying a portfolio of myself, this website is about
          representation. While being proud on the internet as a hardcore
          prototyper, I hope to find likeminded people, and I hope to encourage
          young hardcore prototypers to be proud of themselves too.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, publishing, for instance on Github or Youtube, is most of the
          time a way to get rid of a topic, it isn’t an application to be an
          expert in it and build a career. Hopefully, on this website, it will
          be clear that I’m not aiming for a career in any of the fields
          specifically, but I’m aiming for early stages of things.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h3>The Way into the Website</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          I was postponing writing a list of works for years and obviously the
          longer I waited the more burdensome the task became. How could I make
          it lightweight?
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-lightweight but rewarding approaches were found in Barbara Shers
          <a href="https://gostrengths.com/refuse-to-choose/"
            >'Refuse to Choose'</a
          >, who preaches showing off all the things in one way or another. I
          wrote 'Scanner Daybook' entries for a couple of projects and found it
          very rewarding, and I was looking for more public ways to show all the
          random but significant things I'm doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next idea was making a youtube video every few months, and as I
          was collecting projects from the first quarter of 2020, I realized,
          that that won't work either, because it can't be made incrementally
          (on youtube it is impossible uploading a new version of a video under
          the same URL), and collecting a complete quarter of a year seemed a
          too high hurdle.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then I published
          <a href="cotton_mask.html">things on websites in spring 2020</a>
          and it became obvious to make the portfolio as a webpage. A webpage
          could be done incrementally, it is practical for multimedia, links,
          text search and accessibility, and it has enjoyable aspects to it too
          like learning CSS.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          I'm not a 2d visual person. When starting to work on this website, I
          was working through a web-design book and I was not having the feeling
          to become more competent the more I read. But then it turned into my
          first website with an actual visual design incrementally, which was
          playful and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since it was outdoors and without Covid-19 infection risk, I spent
          much time during stay-home-order on the roof top. And so it happened
          that I wrote the basic structure of this website with the sky as a
          background, and the sky made it into the design as well. <br />
          Obviously this is not a very conceptually driven design choice but
          since this is my first screen design I'm allowing myself to be
          playful. Beginning playfully is always nice.
        </p>
        <p class="draft">first dark theme, and first color scheme at all</p>
      </section>

      <h2>Tech: CSS learnings</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Besides showcasing my works, this website is a learning project. For
          the first time I did
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility"
            >somewhat structured accessibility audits</a
          >
          and changed code for better screenreader-usability. For instance the
          form to choose aspects
          <a href="../index.html">on the front page</a> was a list at first, and
          <a href="https://wave.webaim.org">wave</a> told me that I needed a
          fieldset with a legend, and I happily complied. <br />
          It is the first website where I thoroughly worked with flexbox and I'm
          somewhat comfortable with it now. <br />
          It is also the first website where I thoroughly worked with
          <a
            href="https://blog.kulturbanause.de/2013/08/mobile-first-progressive-enhancement/"
            >progressive enhancement</a
          >, which was a very good experience and it is a technique to stay in
          my repertoire. <br />
          Negative margin is sometimes seen as a dirty trick but on this website
          it is doing a great job for the sky gradient on the bottom of the dark
          mode version of the website. The previous attempt to code the horizon
          into the background failed because it made the end of longer texts
          unreadable since background gradient can only be described in
          percentage and not in em or pixels.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing that remained unsuccessful so far was making a font with my
          own handwriting for the polaroids. Apparently 'handwriting' fonts are
          an advanced subject and I'll try to learn making a font that looks
          like fluorescent tubes instead in order to learn font-making first,
          and use it for the dark mode. <br />
          Other plans for the future are: making a more sophisticated
          roofs-and-antenna-design for the footer and writing the filtering on
          the front page, which is done with jQuery now (because that is what
          I'm reasonably good at), in vanilla JavaScript, because jQuery is an
          unreasonably big ship for showing and hiding a few things, also it
          will give me a good reason to learn more JavaScript.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>Learnings / Outcomes</h2>
      <section class="columns ">
        <p>
          Achieving a list of works will still be a lot of work but at least I
          have started. I started with
          <a href="first_bar_chart_video.html">the Bar Chart Video</a> and
          <a href="cotton_mask.html">the Cotton Mask entry</a>, which were low
          hanging fruits,
          <a href="self_management_2020.html">the Productivity text</a> was
          already much harder to write, but more rewarding too. The further I go
          back in the past the more demanding remembering and finding back
          information about projects will become. I hope this will teach me to
          document things when they are still fresh. On the other hand I also
          noticed that the writing itself is enjoyable, and it being demanding,
          like for the productivity text, can be rewarding in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          A source of annoyance is creating
          <a href="https://ogp.me">open graph content</a>. I want that my
          articles can be shared on social media, but oh my, is creating open
          graph content not my thing! At least I know now, I will never do that
          professionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          More feedback / interaction could be nice, maybe I should share my
          stuff more on social media. But I'm not used to such self-promotion
          and it would also mean that I would have to take open graph content
          more seriously, oh no! :D
        </p>
        <p>
          I very much enjoyed working on the visual design. Polaroids don't
          really work in the dark mode, I'm planning on changing them to movie
          posters, let's see how that goes. I also very much like the 'roofs and
          antennas' footer, check both light and dark mode for full enjoyment.
