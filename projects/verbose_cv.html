      <p class="date">May - July 2020</p>
      <p>This is a draft.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>A list was long overdue</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          "Assembling a list of works" is a thing I should have been doing since
          a long time. Not doing it made me feel guilty in a similar way as not
          "learning to write code", which deserves its own article and obviously
          meanwhile I do write code.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why is it so important and so charged with guilty feelings? <br />
          When introducing to people, it is common to be asked 'So, what do you
          do?', and this is not only a convention but for many people it seems
          to be inevitable knowing, they can't live without. And since I was
          decreasingly able to answer it throughout the years, the question
          became more and more horrible as well in party-like situations as in
          professional ones. It seems like I can either live alone on a hill and
          grow roses or learn to answer the dreaded 'So, what do you do?'
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="columns"></section>
      <h3>But why is it so hard?</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          In short: I do very many things and that is not how most people live
          and there is a lack of role models for 'doing so many things' in our
          nowadays western culture.<br />
          It wasn't always like that, nobody complained about Leonardo DaVinci
          doing many different things, and so one term for this special human
          operating system in 'Renaissance person', other terms are
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">Polymath</a>,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o29KOV0jYRM">Scanner</a> and
          <a
            href="https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare"
            >Multipotentialite</a
          >. So yes, there are terms and self-help-literature, which is better
          than nothing, but it is still not well enough established in our
          culture that I can reply at the party 'I do many thing' and people
          understand and are satisfied with that answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason why it is hard is that I'm not comfortable lying. For a
          while I said to tango people 'I do IT' and to IT pople 'I do tango'
          and it was okay-ish but do I want to be friends with people who are
          happy with me telling them things that are only 10% true? I don't.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, I want to be seen and I want to be proud of myself. Doing
          many things is great, I just have ... a framing problem I guess.
          <br />I love exploring new territory and as soon as I've figured out a
          thing well enough I'll likely drop it and do a new shiny thing, and
          the 'drop it' is quite thorough, chances are that I'm so done with it
          that I'm annoyed with people still believing I'm the same person as
          when I was on the last project and referring to it all the time. So, I
          need to explain myself better, preferably in a way where I don't have
          to explain it to every single person.
        </p>

      <h3>And what can be won!</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p class="draft">
          Part of that better communication should be being proud of that
          special human operating system. It is not only defence, I hope I can
          show off and find more likeminded people. And while doing so, I still
          hope that won't be forced to settle.
          <br />
          Still enjoy beginnings. The publication is a way to get rid of things,
          to be done with it, a ritual.
          <br />
          misunderstanding: most people are proud of finished things, I'm done
          with them
        </p>
      </section>
      <h3>Strategies</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          I was postponing writing a list of works for years and obviously the
          longer I waited the more burdensome the task became. How could I make
          it lightweight? Non-lightweight but rewarding approaches were found in
          Barbara Shers
          <a href="https://gostrengths.com/refuse-to-choose/"
            >'Refuse to Choose'</a
          >, who preaches showing off all the things in one way or another. I
          wrote 'Scanner Daybook' entries for a couple of projects and found it
          very rewarding, and I was looking for more public ways to show all the
          random but significant things I'm doing. <br />
          The next idea was making a youtube video every few months and as I was
          collecting projects from the first quarter of 2020, I realized that
          that won't work either because it can't be made incrementally (on
          youtube it is impossible uploading a new version of a video under the
          same URL), and collecting a complete quarter of a year seemed a too
          high hurdle.
          <br />And then I published
          <a href="cotton_mask.html">things on websites in spring 2020</a>
          and it became obvious to make the portfolio as a webpage. A webpage
          could be done incrementally, it has practical aspects like multimedia,
          links, google text search and accessibility, and it has enjoyable
          aspects to it too like I can learn more CSS.
        </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Since it was outdoors and without Covid-19 infection risk, I spent
          much time during stay-home-order on the roof top. And so it happened
          that I wrote the basic structure of this website with the sky as a
          background, and the sky made it into the design as well. <br />
          Obviously this is not a very conceptually driven design choice but
          since this is my first screen design I'm allowing myself to be
          playful. Beginning playfully is always nice.
        </p>
        <p class="draft">first dark theme</p>
      </section>

      <h2>Tech</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p class="draft">
          it is a learning project. <br />
          * accessibility tests, learnt things <br />
          * overall very happy with tech stack<br />
          * for the first time happy with much flexbox use<br />
          * learnt new things eg ‘sky’ gradient background negative margin to
          make the footer a skyline that ‘sticks to the floor’<br />
          * own Handschrift failed so far<br />
          * 1st color scheme + dark theme<br />
          * open graph content is annoying<br />
          * the filtering works with jQuery and as a future project I might
          learn proper java script <br />
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>Learnings / Outcomes</h2>
      <section class="columns ">
        <p>
          Achieving a list of works will still be a lot of work but at least I
          have started. I started with
          <a href="first_bar_chart_video.html">the Bar Chart Video</a> and
          <a href="cotton_mask.html">the Cotton Mask entry</a>, which were low
          hanging fruits,
          <a href="self_management_2020.html">the Productivity text</a> was
          already much harder to write, but more rewarding too. The further I go
          back in the past the more demanding remembering and finding back
          information about projects. I hope this will teach me to document
          things when they are still fresh. But I also see that the writing
          itself is enjoyable, and it being demanding, like the productivity
          text, can be rewarding in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          A source of annoyance is creating
          <a href="https://ogp.me">open graph content</a>. I want that my
          articles can be shared on social media but oh my is creating open
          graph content not my thing! At least I know now, I will never do that
          professionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          More feedback / interaction could be nice, maybe I should share my
          stuff more on social media. But I'm not used to such self-promotion
          and it would also mean that I would have to take open graph content
          more seriously, oh no! :D
        </p>
        <p>
          I very much like the visual design and I enjoy working on the visual
          design. Polaroids don't really work in the dark mode, I'm planning on
          changing them to movie posters, let's see how that goes. I also very
          much like the 'roofs and antennas' footer, check both light and dark
          mode for full enjoyment.
