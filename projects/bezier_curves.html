      <h2>It is a curve ... and we'll calculate points</h2>

      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Essentially, a Bézier curve is a curve described by a couple of points
          and a formula, and is used in computer graphics, for instance
          typography. In case of a cookie cutter, I use it to model things that
          are curvy but not exactly round like a circle or ellipse.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mathematics, things can be infinite and curves can be perfectly
          smooth, but in computer graphics curvy things are approximated by
          points and tiny flat surfaces. This is why in the algorithms used, I
          calculate many points as the basis of what is going on.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>Mathematical definition</h2>

      <h3>
        The formula:
        <span class="code">p1 * [0...1] + p2 * [1...0]</span>
      </h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          In the (not very useful) case of a Bézier curve that is only defined
          by the end points and no middle-points that curve it, it could be
          calculated like this:
        </p>

        <pre> <code class="OpenSCAD">// two points
p1 = [5, 7.5];
p2 = [7, 2];

// how many points will be calculated
n = 15;

// calculating points between p1 and p2
for (i = [0 : 1/n : 1])
  translate( p1 * i + p2 * (1-i) )
    sphere(0.2);

// displaying the end points
for (i = [p1, p2]) translate(i)
  color("black") sphere(0.2);</code> </pre>
        <p>
          Please copy the code into OpenSCAD to watch it rendered.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h3>... used recursively</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          If a third point gets added and the curve gets curvy, the formula
          <span class="nobr code">'p1 * [0...1] + p2 * [1...0]' </span> gets
          called recursively.
        </p>

        <pre> <code class="OpenSCAD">p1 = [5, 7.5];
p2 = [7, 2];
p3 = [1, 1.7];
n = 15;

// a Bézier curve [p1, p2, p3]
for (i = [0 : 1/n : 1])
  translate(
      (p1 * i + p2 * (1-i)) * i
    + (p2 * i + p3 * (1-i)) * (1-i) )
      sphere(0.2);

for (i = [p1, p2, p3]) translate(i)
  color("black") sphere(0.2);</code> </pre>
      </section>

      <h2>The production code ...</h2>

      <section class="columns">

          For easier copy-pasting, the code is displayed in one go, and
          commented below. <br />
          Please play with fs and the points to explore how it works.

      <h2>... commented</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <h3>fs</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike 'n' in the section before, we will work with a number of points
          that is calculated from the first and last point of the curve, and a
          variable fs, which works roughly like $fs, it says how large
          approximately the distance between the calculated points shall be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recursive functions are expensive in computing power and, depending
          what you do with it, OpenSCAD is already slow. The point of fs being a
          global variable here is that you can use a 'larger' number during most
          of the production and calculate a finely grained model only when you
          need it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can tell from the rendered file, the distance of the points is
          not perfectly even, but usually good enough, after all we are behind
          the curve and not the points.
        </p>
        <h3>function fn( )</h3>
        <p>
          fn( ) calculates a number, which will be the number of the points of a
          curve, from the distance of two points and fs.
        </p>
        <h3>functions b_pts( ) and b_curv( )</h3>
        <p>
          In the production code, I split the points-calculating mechanism into
          two functions, where b_pts( ) is the same regardless of what the model
          does and b_curv( ) can vary, depending on what I plan to do with the
          Bézier curve. Furthermore I find it, with this separation, easier to
          read and maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          b_pts( ) contains the recursive mechanism and returns a number. It is
          called for each point separately. It is called with an array of points
          'pts', a number in how many points the curve will be calculated 'n',
          and a number which of the points will be calculated 'idx'. <br />
          It asks: 'Am I given more than two points in the array 'pts'?' And if
          yes, it calls itself for the first to the second-last point multiplied
          by n*idx and adds calling itself for the second to the last point,
          multiplied with 1-n*idx. <br />
          If the number of points in the array is two, it does the familiar
          <span class="code">'p1 * [0...1] + p2 * [1...0]'</span> thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In b_curv( ), which is called with an array of points 'pts', the
          calculation of the points is organized. It calls fn( ) with the first
          and last point in 'pts' to get the variable fn. And then from zero to
          fn, it calls b_pts( ) in order to calculate each point, and
          concatenates them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the item modeled it a cookie-cutter, I already use b_curv as a
          module to build shapes.
        </p>
        <h3>rainbow ( )</h3>
        <p>
          The module 'rainbow ( )' receives an array of points and displays them
          in a colorful manner so they are visible and provide a sense how they
          are ordered in the array. The module has
          <a
            href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/OpenScad-random/blob/main/modules/rainbow.scad"
            >its own place on GitHub.
          </a>

      <h2>Choosing locations for points</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <img
          src="../img/letter_d.jpg"
          alt="typographic letter 'd', where the points that define the Bézier-curves are added"
        />

        <p>
          The most commonly used amount of points is four, this is also called
          'cubic curve'. The first and the last point are the both ends of the
          curve and the points between make the curve curvy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a Bézier curve starts at one side, it first starts going towards
          the second point and then the influence of the third point grows
          stronger and so on. If differential calculus feels familiar to you,
          think of it as that the derivative function at the start of the curve
          points towards the second point.
        </p>

        <p>
          And this is why, in typography, the start and end points of the curves
          are commonly set at
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the pointy ends of the letter and</li>
          <li>
            the most right, left, top and bottom points of a curvy shape.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This can be observed in the image of the letter d, where the red dots
          are the starts and ends of the curves and the black dots are the
          points in-between.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at the bottom left curve of the letter d, between points
          10 and 13. Notice that all four point are either on the x or the y
          axis. And now take a look at the two adjacent curves, 7-10 and 13-16.
          You'll notice that point 9 is located on the x axis as well and point
          14 n the y-axis. Having point 9, 10 and 11 in one axis provides a
          smooth curve around point 10, and the easiest way to make that happen
          is locating all of them with the same y-value (0). Similarly, the
          continuous nature of the curve around point 13 ensures by points 12,
          13 and 14 all having the same x-value (0).
