        <p>
          By the time I became
          <a href="https://triplenine.org/International/LocalVolunteers.aspx">
            International Coordinator</a
          >, a new TNS member map was wished for by the membership since several
          months. And after the most urgent tasks of my new office had to be
          done, planning further improvements made me interested in how the
          membership is distributed. I analyzed the data that is available to
          me, just as to every member, in a Jupyter notebook and made some
          visualizations. Then it dawned on me that I had recently made
          <a href="999trees.html">the trees map</a> as a Leaflet map, which
          deemed suitable for a TNS member map as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          I recommend checking the
          <a href="https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/"
            >leaflet provider demo</a
          >
          out, for enjoyment and for insight how far
          <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> based maps
          have come. The TNS member map has several base layers,
          <a href="https://map.safecast.org">SafeCast</a> and
          <a href="https://www.openrailwaymap.org">OpenRailwayMap</a>. It is for
          members only, but here are
          <a href="../documents/map_layers_2025-10-12.html"
            >the map without coordinates</a
          >
          and
          <a href="../documents/map_many_layers.ipynb"
            >the Jupyter notebook that builds it</a
          >
          for you. OpenRailwayMap doesn't work properly in Chrome and Firefox
          though, due to security settings, that can be altered by the user, but
          one might just use Safari or Edge to make it work.
