      <h2>About</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          In my own words I'd explain
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone">Shepard tones</a>
          like that: you'd press all keys on a piano with the same name, for
          instance all f-keys, at the same time, and the ones in the middle
          harder than the very high or low ones, so that the volume would be
          distributed like a bell curve and the tones outside of the piano just
          disappear under the hearing threshold, see the image below.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/streifen.jpg" alt="shepard tones under a bell curve" />
        <p>
          In case of f you'd end up with an f without a specific height. When
          playing an upward or downward scale, the tones seem to go up (or down)
          but never leave the hearing range as long as the bell curve stays in
          place. Such a Shepard scale can go on for a long time, and this is a
          common effect in film music, for instance in
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKkCP7ovMQA">Dunkirk</a>,
          where the sound seems to rise indefinitely.
        </p>

        <p>
          The original publication "Circularity in Judgements of Relative Pitch"
          by Roger Shepard was published in 1964 in the Journal of the
          Acoustical Society of America.

          <a href="https://youtu.be/Gn0A9Fa_APg"
            >Shepard tones are implemented in SuperCollider</a
          >
          but I wasn't able to understand the code and so I wrote
          <a
            href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/Sonic-Pi-Shepard-tones-function"
            >a Shepard tone implementation in Sonic Pi</a
          >, my first and only Ruby project. The code is much shorter than in
          the SuperCollider implementation and it comes with options like chords
          of Shepard tones, alternative synths (meaning others than sine waves)
          and the positioning of the bell curve as a parameter.

      <h2>Contradictory sound</h2>

        <p>
          In electronic music there can be a sliding scale, unlike on a piano
          with its discrete tones. <br />
          In my implementation of Shepard tones the placement of the bell curve
          can be moved while the sound is playing. Practical aspects of what
          your ears and your speakers are able to aside, the bell curve can even
          be moved into the hearing range and out of it.
          <br />
          For the small composition in the video I used the possibility to slide
          both the bell curve and the pitch, the bell curve moves from a high
          pitch to a low pitch and the frequency goes the other way, the sound
          gets higher and lower at the same time.
