        At the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 related stay-home-order I was looking
        for something to engage in other than siting on the couch. And since I
        am somewhat decently able to sew (which was actually my first job as a
        young adult), it was obvious that sewing masks could be a thing.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        I found a charity that would happily take masks from me,
        <a href="http://www.delatorre-stiftung.de">Jenny de la Torre Stiftung</a
        >, who does basic medical service for homeless people.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        But after sewing a few masks, I remembered that I actually donâ€™t like
        sewing and felt the need to entertain myself intellctually. It was an
        incentive to optimize things, what would be the best combination of
        aspects of self-made face masks for sewing and use? I could use my
        knowledge about the process of sewing and pros and cons regarding face
        mask features and my overall good understanding of three-dimensional
        things to to judge what kind of mask has the over all least
        disadvantages.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        And once I was there I set up a github pages site and
        <a
          href="https://benjaminwand.github.io/Cotton-Mask/instructions/BenjaminW-2.html"
          >publish my instruction.</a
        >
        The website also includes an earlier mask type of mine and a mask sewing
        instruction of
        <a href="https://twitter.com/D_70WN">D_70WN</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Obviously what is good and what isn't is subjectice, other people
        decided similar questions differently, based on their
        mask-wearing-preferences, aesthetic preferences and sewing-process likes
        and dislikes. I had conversations with other people who sew face masks
        and we assembled a
        <a href="https://benjaminwand.github.io/Cotton-Mask/tabelle.html"
          >table of aspects of self-made face masks and their pros and cons.</a
        >
        Except for sewing-laziness the motivation for my decisions were that I
        wanted a robust and no-fuss mask that I could go jogging with and I
        wanted to give others masks of a similar standard. A difference though
        was that the Jenny-de-la-Torre-Stiftung wanted masks without threads for
        easier cleaning and so they got masks without threads.
