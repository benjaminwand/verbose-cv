        <p>
          At the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 related stay-home-order I was
          looking for something to engage in other than siting on the couch. And
          since I am somewhat decently able to sew (which was actually my first
          job as a young adult), it was obvious that sewing masks could be a
          thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found a charity that would happily take masks from me,
          <a href="http://www.delatorre-stiftung.de"
            >Jenny de la Torre Stiftung</a
          >, who does basic medical service for homeless people.
        </p>
        <p>
          But after sewing a few masks, I remembered that I actually donâ€™t like
          sewing and felt the need to entertain myself intellctually. It was an
          incentive to optimize things, what would be the best combination of
          aspects of self-made face masks for sewing and use? I could use my
          knowledge about the process of sewing and pros and cons regarding face
          mask features and my overall good understanding of three-dimensional
          things to to judge what kind of mask has the over all least
          disadvantages.
        </p>

        <p>
          And once I was there
          <a
            href="https://benjaminwand.github.io/Cotton-Mask/instructions/BenjaminW-2.html"
            >I set up a github pages site and published my instruction.</a
          >
          The website also includes an earlier mask type of mine and a mask
          sewing instruction of
          <a href="https://twitter.com/D_70WN">D_70WN</a> in German and English
          (mine are German only).
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously what is good and what isn't is subjectice, other people
          decided similar questions differently, based on their
          mask-wearing-preferences, aesthetic preferences and sewing-process
          likes and dislikes. I had conversations with other people who sew face
          masks and we assembled a
          <a href="https://benjaminwand.github.io/Cotton-Mask/tabelle.html"
            >table of aspects of self-made face masks and their pros and
            cons.</a
          ><br />
          Except for sewing-laziness the motivation for my decisions were that I
          wanted a robust and no-fuss mask that I could go jogging with and I
          wanted to give others masks of a similar standard. A difference though
          was that the Jenny-de-la-Torre-Stiftung wanted masks without threads
          for easier cleaning and so they got masks without threads.
