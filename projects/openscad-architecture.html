        <p>
          Studying architecture at
          <a href="https://www.tu.berlin">TU Berlin</a> I was thankfully granted
          permission to use the computer for my technical drawings at a point in
          time when my class mates still had to use the pencil. <br />
          Naturally I resorted to <a href="https://openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a>.
          It gave me some little joys, but the more the project progressed the
          more I was faced with OpenSCAD being slow. Here are some learnings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Making everything parametric, including the colors, is nice for the
            workflow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth"
              >single source of truth</a
            >
            is a benefit to programming, try to only display the things one
            needs at a point in time helps. This results in <i> lots</i> of
            <code class="OpenSCAD"> if (something) </code> in the code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mysteriously slow is creating 2d things with projection. I should
            try finding a faster way to get those. (The reason I used projection
            to begin with was getting images at a specific size, eg 1:200.
            Export as pdf can do that.)
          </li>
          <li>Next time: work with multiple files in order to scroll less.</li>
          <li>
            The walls in the image are black because they should be black in the
            floor plans. This was a mistake, I should have distinguished between
            'walls seen from the outside' and 'walls that are cut' earlier in
            the process.
          </li>
          <li>
            That OpenSCAD is unsuitable for visualization isn't an actual
            problem. I thought I would render the building in Rhino afterwards
            but I didn't, I just drew some little trees into it with a graphic
            app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Weird in OpenSCAD: which color something has when using bool
            operations is pretty unpredictable to me.
          </li>
        </ul>
