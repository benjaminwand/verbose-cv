      <p class="date">Text published: October 2023</p>

    <article>
      <p>
        This is a text I wrote for the October 2023 edition of
        <a href="https://triplenine.org/Vidya">Vidya</a> that I want to share
        with a wider audience now.
      </p>
      <h2>Preface</h2>

      <p>
        I'm a TNS member for a year now and for the most part I'm very happy
        with it. One aspect where I see room for improvement though is regarding
        volunteering. One of my former/other social groups is the Chaos Computer
        Club, in particular its events, where I have been volunteering and
        serving in leadership roles for more than ten years now, and with its
        very talented and opinionated members the CCC isn't too different from
        TNS. The culture around volunteering is very different though. At events
        of the CCC it is self evident that volunteering is great, volunteering
        is especially recommended for first time visitors because it is a good
        way to get to know people and understand how everything works. It is so
        much fun that many people arrive before the event to help buildup.
        Volunteering is part of the experience.<br />
        Now, as egg planning is moving from Thorsten Heitzmann doing most
        administrative things to more of a group effort, Iâ€™d like to bring some
        of my CCC volunteering experience to the next egg and hope it will
        radiate into other parts of TNS. Here I share with you my observations
        and thoughts that are likely transferable to volunteering for TNS
        events:
      </p>
      <h2>Consider intrinsic motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Volunteers don't get paid with money, but, if it goes well, in ways that
        hook into their intrinsic motivation. Here are aspects of intrinsic
        motivation that I've observed mattering for doing the volunteer
        motivation puzzle:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          contributing to something that one values and partaking in one's
          community life
        </li>
        <li>
          cultivating skills and exploring new fields (that one can't get paid
          for yet)
        </li>
        <li>
          the task itself / flow / pursuing a certain aesthetic or perfection
          (for instance I did a bottle sorting shift once and found that
          strangely satisfying)
        </li>
        <li>
          collateral benefit (for instance if I still need to prepare slides for
          a talk, I can still make them while performing a low-attention task
          like a door shift. Similarly, signing up for a wristband crimping
          shift allows me to greet people more personally)
        </li>
        <li>
          having a pre-defined social role (this tends to be helpful for people
          who are socially awkward)
        </li>
        <li>working with a team that one enjoys</li>
        <li>the little joys of pet projects</li>
        <li>
          and probably most importantly: helping fellow humans, people love
          that!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Don't only consider which work needs to be done but also what the
        volunteer might get out of it!
      </p>

      <h2>Angels and Officers - distribute the work well</h2>
      <p>
        People love to help but not necessarily the whole day long. Some tasks
        are rather complex to transfer from one person to the other and then
        they better stick with a person for a while. Let's call those people
        "officers" for now, because TNS already uses that word. Other tasks are
        easier to cut into chunks, and when possible I'd suggest doing so rather
        than creating new permanent positions. At the CCC those small volunteer
        shifts are usually two hours long and the volunteers are called
        'angels'. An example is a 'microphone angel', the person who makes
        people speak into the microphone during Q&A sessions. <br />
        There can be tasks between officer and angel too. For instance we'll
        call for a volunteer who makes graphics for egg to make the print and
        online articles look nicer. This certainly takes more than two hours but
        we don't need a TNS graphics officer either, it is a task that can
        change person from event to event. The TNS historian doesn't necessarily
        need to be an officer either, one might as well define a standard how to
        archive things and let several people, maybe even everyone, contribute.
      </p>
      <h2>Prioritize motivation over skill when appropriate</h2>
      <p>
        For some positions, such as the Information Officer and the Financial
        Officer, skill and prior experience may be needed to avoid negative
        outcomes. Other volunteer tasks can be learnt on the job and opting for
        a volunteer without professional experience is acceptable or even
        preferred. For instance if child care gets implemented at TNS events, I
        wouldn't want to push that onto a professional school teacher if we have
        one, because they certainly want a break from their job too. If people
        are interested in something, they can learn it, therefore for
        non-critical positions I would always prefer to ask "What would you like
        to contribute?" over "What are you good at?" And if skill and motivation
        coincides, that is a gift but not a requirement.<br />
        It also means that we should be tolerant of the quirkiness of
        volunteers, and distinguish between benign or neutral differences and
        those with risk of harm.
      </p>
      <h2>Creative leeway</h2>
      <p>
        "What would we like to contribute?" is also a question that I'd often
        prefer over "What should we do?", because the latter tends to result in
        lengthy and sometimes heated discussions and not in getting stuff done.
        Give the volunteers some liberty to fill the role with their style, and
        allow pet projects! Here is an example for a pet project at CCC: the
        Video operation center and the Phone operation center made
        <a href="https://youtu.be/jVNlDFH_B0w"
          >a song and music video that praises DECT</a
        >. It was by no means needed, but they had fun, so why not! <br />
        Looking at it from a slightly different angle one might phrase it 'don't
        micromanage volunteers'.
      </p>

      <h2>Avoid post processing / consider timing of motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Shortly before an event and during the event the motivation to do
        something is usually high, and afterwards everyone is tired.
        Understanding that, the Video operation center arranged its work in such
        a way that 99% of it is done during the event. The videos are edited
        live and after the talk they are just cut off at the start and end and
        the intro video gets added, and then they get published like that. The
        cameras hold backup recordings, but only in very rare cases are they
        used, because no one wants to go to the trouble for minor issues.
      </p>

      <h2>Document along rather than after</h2>
      <p>
        People always want documentation but nobody wants to write it. You are
        doing a huge favor for the person who is performing the task after you
        and future TNS historians if there is some written material, so try to
        find a way to document that isn't a burden and doesn't wear you out, so
        it can be done consistently. <br />
        Timing can be an aspect of it. Here is an example from DiVOC, a series
        of online conferences during the pandemic, regarding writing meeting
        protocols:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          before the meeting there was a pad (collaborative online document,
          like an open source google doc) where all meeting attendees can write
          their topics when they come to their mind (setting the agenda with
          little mental load), if topics come up during the meeting they can be
          added
        </li>
        <li>
          during the meeting the protocol gets written by more than one person
          in exactly that document (no-one gets worn out, people learn to
          cooperate)
        </li>
        <li>
          by the end of the meeting the protocol is finished and approved (no
          post-production duties).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This doesn't produce the documentation of some people's dreams but at
        least nobody needs to put extra time into it.
      </p>

      <h2>Use information gatekeeping deliberately</h2>
      <p>
        Some information needs to be protected, for instance personal data, but
        beyond that chances are it works best when all team members have access
        to all information. Sometimes there are practical considerations,
        accessible information shortens the training period when a member
        changes teams, but having the chance to understand how everything works
        also enables volunteers and helps motivate people who have the habit of
        working self-determined.
      </p>

      <h2>Welcome new ideas through a wishlist</h2>

      <p>
        This is an idea for TNS without a CCC observation. It frequently happens
        that people want something to be done by someone else. How about having
        a place for it, a place for wishes that no one has committed to yet?
        Then the person with the wish can feel heard without guilting volunteers
        into extra work. <br />
        For instance I wish for a cinema to have the talks in at egg. Comfy
        seats, great sound and more projector than we ever need. I know it is
        unlikely to become real any soon but bringing ideas out there without
        pressuring volunteers - that would be great too.
      </p>

      <h2>Goodies</h2>
      <p>
        Intrinsic motivation of our volunteers is their driving force and
        rewards are appropriate. They can be in the form of little "privileges"
        or material tokens of gratitude: At large CCC events angels get free
        food and if they work a lot they get a t-shirt that can't be bought for
        money, which they wear with pride.
      </p>

      <h2>Outlook</h2>
      <p>
        Like probably many of you, I was delighted to see so many very good
        candidates for the Member-at-Large position this August, so yes, people
        in TNS want to volunteer. That is great! I'm looking forwards to seeing
        future developments and to being a part of them. <br />
        Bryan Lundgren has suggested that TNS could have Volunteer Coordinator,
        and if it continues the way it looks like now that can be me for the
        next egg. I'm not sure about my readiness to serve in such a role for
        TNS as a whole but I'd very happily talk about things regarding
        volunteering with those who want to.
