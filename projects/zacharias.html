          >
          was a German engineer and inventor who lived 1924 â€“ 2020, and in
          October 2017 I visited him in Hamburg. Beyond listening to his story I
          took two little videos of him displaying two of his works, and he gave
          me a gift.

      <section>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavinet">Clavinet</a> is
          an electrified version of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavichord">Clavichord</a>.
          Here is Ernst Zacharias playing it:

      <h2>Reversed reed pipes</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          One of his research fields was a getting
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_(instrument)">Sheng</a
          >-like pipes to work for organs by installing a harmonica reed into a
          resonator in the reversed way. It results in the pipe having the pitch
          of the resonator and not of the reed, although, like generally in
          orgen pipes, generator and resonator need to be coordinated in order
          to work well together.

      <h2>'Wind-less organ pipes'</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Expecting his end, Zacharias gave his 'wind-less organ pipes' to
          visitors, and I received a trumpet shaped one. A resonator has a
          microphone on one end and a speaker on the other, and the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_feedback"
            >audio feedback</a
          >
          is shaped by the resonator.
