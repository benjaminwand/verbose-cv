      <h2>Previously</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        When I was asked to teach philosophy to a private student in February
        2021, I felt a little confused and conflicted. Although I had studied
        philosophy in my early twenties, in the recent years I thought the best
        thing one can do with it is theory of science, and otherwise philosophy
        is about at good and useful as contemplating whether ketchup is a
        smoothie. But then, I was offered money, and, being endlessly curious, I
        quite like being appointed to absurd-ish positions.
      </section>
      <h2>Practically</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        The student is a retired architect. We are reading Sophie's World and I
        prepare homework for him. So far in his life he had been used to dealing
        with decidable and practical subjects and introducing him to discourse
        is challenging, both for him and me. Here is an example: as part of the
        homework for Helenism I asked 'What does it take for a good life?' and
        since half of the chapter was about that question, I expected him to
        work with some of the arguments presented. Instead he came up with a
        four word answer that had nothing to do with the Greeks. So in the next
        lesson we tried to figure out what the Cynics, Stoics and Epicureans
        thought what it takes for a good life. <br />
        Being a theory teacher for the first time, I have to learn to give
        useful homework. If I do not explicitly say 'justify your reasoning', I
        typically get answers like 'Yes' or 'I don't like him'. (He dislikes
        Aristotle.) And even if that is a little frustrating, that way I
        probably learn more than him. I'm convinced that trying to get him used
        to answers longer than four words is important in order for him to be
        able to learn anything about philosophy at all. <br />
        To make things less frustrating, I try mixing it up with tasks in
        cultural studies, for instance I asked for a short presentation about
        the Olympic games of antiquity. The culture-things are much easier for
        him than the philosophical ones.
      </section>
      <h2>Positioning</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        So, what do I think now, is ketchup a smoothie? Remembering that
        European philosophy started with Socrates 'I know that I don't know',
        suddenly made it likable. I profoundly agree to the appreciation of not
        knowing, as itself and as a requirement for deeper understanding. If
        differentiating oneself from people who feel safe in their knowledge was
        the birth place of European intellectual history, we can continue to
        learn and humanity might not be lost.<br />
        Dealing with philosophy again also made me realize that I am an
        Empiricist in the age of computers and big data, I believe that in order
        to understand things we need data that is acquired in a traceable way,
        which is what made me feel uneasy about theories that are theory-only,
        like proves of God. (One might still enjoy them like a science fiction
        novel though.) It would be a philosophical question to ask whether
        humanity is able to live in peace and if yes under which conditions, but
        I want a scientific, psychological or sociological answer to that and
        not a speculation in thin air.<br />
        So, on the one hand I'm still at 'philosophy is good for theory of
        science' with some added trips to rationalist sci-fi land, but I also
        learnt that, being endlessly curious and enjoying learning together in a
        dialogue, I am a philosopher.
