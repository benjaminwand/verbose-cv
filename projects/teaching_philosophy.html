      <h2>Previously</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        When I was asked to teach philosophy to a private student in February
        2021, I felt a little confused and conflicted. Although I had studied
        philosophy in my early twenties, in the recent years I thought the best
        thing one can do with it is theory of science, and otherwise philosophy
        is about as good and useful as contemplating whether ketchup is a
        smoothie. But then, I was offered money, and, being endlessly curious, I
        quite like being appointed to absurd-ish positions.
      </section>
      <h2>Practically</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        The student is a retired architect. We are reading Sophie's World and I
        prepare homework for him. So far in his life he had been used to dealing
        with decidable and practical subjects and introducing him to discourse
        is challenging, both for him and me. <br />
        Being a theory teacher for the first time, I have to learn to give
        useful homework. If I do not explicitly say 'justify your reasoning', I
        typically get answers like 'Yes' or 'I don't like him'. (He dislikes
        Aristotle.) And even if that is a little frustrating, I probably learn
        more than him. <br />
        To make things less frustrating, I try mixing it up with tasks in
        cultural studies, for instance I asked for a short presentation about
        Architecture subjects of the times we're in. The culture-subjects are
        much easier for him than the philosophical ones. <br />
        Mostly we spend two weeks with each chapter/philosopher, except when I
        find it more interesting like with Descartes and Kant. So far he hasn't
        expressed interest in specific philosophers or philosophical questions
        but I hope that it will happen before we are finished (what ever that
        means).
      </section>
      <h2>Positioning</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        So, what do I think now, is ketchup a smoothie?
        <h3>Socrates made a good start</h3>
        Getting reminded that European philosophy started with Socrates 'I know
        that I don't know', suddenly made it likable again. I profoundly agree
        to the appreciation of not knowing, as itself and as a requirement for
        deeper understanding. If differentiating oneself from people who feel
        safe in their knowledge was the birth place of European intellectual
        history, we can continue to learn and humanity might not be lost.
        <h3>Empiricism!</h3>
        Dealing with philosophy again also made me realize that I am an
        Empiricist in the age of computers and big data, I believe that in order
        to understand things we need acquired data about real life, which during
        studying made me feel uneasy about theories that are theory-only. (One
        might still enjoy them like fiction though.&nbsp;*)
        <br />
        It would be a philosophical question to ask whether humanity is able to
        live in peace and under which conditions, but I want a scientific,
        psychological or sociological answer to that and not discussions of
        someone who made up their own image of humanity. This is a hard filter,
        I don't have much humor for economic or psychological theories built on
        a self invented image of human as well.
        <h3>Being a philosopher</h3>
        So, on the one hand I'm still at 'philosophy is good for theory of
        science', but I also learnt that, being endlessly curious and enjoying
        learning together in a dialogue, I am a philosopher.

        * For your rationalism entertainment, here is how the Proof of God by
        René Descartes works: He has a sense of a perfect being, and he notices
        that his buddies have that too. This image of perfection can't come from
        his own, limited mind, it has to come from the perfect being itself.
        Therefore god exists. Isn't that delightful?<br />
        Here is another one:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Descartes">Descartes</a>
        starts his book
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_the_Method"
          >Discourse on the Method</a
        >
        'The sound mind is what is best distributed in the world because
        everyone thinks they have enough, and even people who are difficult to
        satisfy in other regards, do not desire more understanding than they
        have.' Hallelujah! &#128517;
