          Writing cookie cutters made me explore
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézier_curve">Bézier curves</a

          I wrote my own and made a tutorial video.

      <h3>It is a curve ... but we'll calculate points</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/pnYccz1Ha34"
            >This is the video that initially made me understand Bézier
            curves.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Essentially, a Bézier curve is a curve described by a couple of points
          and a formula, and is used in computer graphics, for instance
          computer-described typography. In case of a cookie cutter, I use it to
          model things that are curv-ish but not exactly round like a circle or
          ellipse.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mathematics, things can be infinite and curves can be perfectly
          smooth, but in computer graphics curvy things are approximated by
          points and tiny flat surfaces. This is why in the algorithms used, I
          calculate many points as the basis of what is going on.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h3>Mathematical definition</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <h4>
          The formula:
          <span class="code">p1 * [0...1] + p2 * [1...0]</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          In the not very useful case of a Bézier curve that would only be
          defined by the end points and no middle-points that curve it, it could
          be calculated like this:
        </p>
        <pre> <code class="Java">// two points
p1 = [5, 7.5];
p2 = [7, 2];

// how many points will be calculated
n = 15;

// calculating points between p1 and p2
for (i = [0 : 1/n : 1])
  translate( p1 * i + p2 * (1-i) )
    sphere(0.2);

// displaying the end points
for (i = [p1, p2]) translate(i)
  color("black") sphere(0.2);</code> </pre>
        <h4>... used recursively</h4>
        <p>
          If a third point gets added and the curve gets curvy, the formula
          <span class="nobr code">'p1 * [0...1] + p2 * [1...0]' </span> gets
          called recursively.
        </p>
        <pre> <code class="Java">p1 = [5, 7.5];
p2 = [7, 2];
p3 = [1, 1.7];
n = 15;

// a Bézier curve [p1, p2, p3]
for (i = [0 : 1/n : 1])
  translate(
      (p1 * i + p2 * (1-i)) * i
    + (p2 * i + p3 * (1-i)) * (1-i) )
      sphere(0.2);

for (i = [p1, p2, p3]) translate(i)
  color("black") sphere(0.2);</code> </pre>
      </section>

      <h3>Choosing locations for points</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <img
          src="../img/letter_d.jpg"
          alt="typographic letter 'd', where the points that define the Bézier-curves are added"
        />

        <p>
          The most commonly used amount of points used is four. The first and
          the last point are the both ends of the curve and the points between
          make the curve curvy, like the sides of the fairydust rocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a Bézier curve starts at one side, it first starts going towards
          the second point and then the influence of the third point grows
          stronger and so on. If differential calculus feels familiar to you,
          think of it as that the derivative function at the start of the curve
          points towards the second point.
        </p>

        <p>
          And this is why, in typography, the start and end points of the curves
          are commonly set at
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the pointy ends of the letter and</li>
          <li>
            the most right, left, top and bottom points of a curvy shape.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This can be observed in the image of the letter d, where the red dots
          are the starts and ends of the curves and the black dots are the
          points in-between.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at the bottom left curve of the letter d, between points
          10 and 13. Notice that all four point are either on the x or the y
          axis. And now take a look at the two adjacent curves, 7-10 and 13-16.
          You'll notice that point 9 is located on the x axis as well and point
          14 n the y-axis. Having point 9, 10 and 11 in one axis provides a
          smooth curve around point 10, and the easiest way to make that happen
          is locating all of them with the same y-value (0), the same way as the
          continuous nature of the curve around point 13 ensures by points 12,
          13 and 14 all having the same x-value (0).
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>There will be a demo video</h2>
      <p>
        Soon I will make a video where I model a cookie cutter, to demonstrate
        the concepts from the existing video.
