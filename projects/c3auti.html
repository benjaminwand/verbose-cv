      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Disclaimer: I’m speaking from my perspective here, but let’s keep in
          mind that such group activities are always a group effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://help.ccc.de/c3auti/index.en.html">c3auti</a>
          is a volunteer organisation that cares for the needs of autistic
          people at events of the Chaos Computer Club. <br />
          When I first heard of it, I laughed, because: maybe a third of the
          people at Chaos events show autistic traits, and suddenly we need a
          committee for that? But it turns out we do need one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In August 2019
          <a href="https://twitter.com/fair_sein">fairsein</a> recruited me for
          c3auti for the
          <a href="https://events.ccc.de/camp/2019/wiki/Main_Page"
            >Chaos Communication Camp</a
          >, and as I was looking for a new team anyway, I joined. It was
          chaotic and enjoyable, and there were organisational challenges that
          spurned my ambition and my lust for improving organisational things.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>At Camp</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          During Camp I had my first experiences with helping autistics in
          stressful situations, which I previously had been unfamiliar with. My
          way of approaching this was treating them like people who got stuck on
          a bad trip in hypnosis, using simplified language and assuming them to
          have normal needs but being limited in language and rational thinking.
          Although I couldn’t find connections between hypnosis and autism (I
          searched!), I couldn’t find any, but practically that approach was
          successful, I got good feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other people who worked at c3auti had different approaches, this was
          interesting to see. We recognize it when we see it, but explaining how
          to care for someone well is hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the management side my contributions were little, like writing
          meeting protocols.
          <br />
          Until Camp 2019, one had to be autistic to have a leading role at
          c3auti and I found that problematic for two reasons: I think we should
          not force people to out themselves and diversity in a team is always
          good, it is good having neurotypical people in responsible roles too.
          I helped ease the way into having non-autistics at c3auti.

      <h2>Congress planning</h2>

      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          When the
          <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"
            >36th Chaos Communication Congress</a
          >
          drew nearer, I became a team lead at c3auti. Things that were brought
          forward through me were doing the QuietQube, writing better
          documentation, organizing things early enough and changing the
          staffing structure.
        </p>

        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>
          In short, I did my best to have good meeting protocolls and other
          written material, like a shift schedule, so future people who do
          c3auti at congress have something to start from and don't need to
          reinvent everyhing every year. I knew, and made public before
          congress, that I would't stay at c3auti forever, and so involving and
          teaching future activists was important.
        </p>
        <div class="inline-block">
          <h3>Staffing</h3>
          <p>
            A troublesome aspect at camp was the team role 'coordinator',
            because it wasn't well defined what they have to coordinate at all,
            different people understood their job differently. If one would have
            done the sum of everyones opinion, that would have been superhuman.
            For Congress I ended up splitting the job in two: a management
            person who would moderate meetings, make sure everyone can work well
            and onboards new team members, and a specialist for emergencies
            (coordinating emergency missions). <br />
            I'd recommend that separation for events larger than 3000 people, at
            small events there just aren't enough qualified volunteers for both
            roles.

      <h2>The QuietQube</h2>

      <section class="columns">
        <h3>Origin and conceptual thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Here is a thing that bugged me at camp: on the one hand people at
          c3auti were encouraged to not ask for diagnosis but on the other hand
          the room was for autistics, therefore by using it one would out
          oneself. My aspiration for inclusion is high and I think that it is
          necessary to ask for needs and not for diseases (whether or not one
          thinks of autism as a disease, or a disability). Therefore, I found it
          important that a room that caters for the (socializing) needs of
          autistics should be defined or described in a way that it caters for
          needs and not by 'is for autistics'.
        </p>
        <div class="inline-block">
          <p>
            We decladed rules as following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>no music</li>
            <li>
              blinking has to be limited to the most necessary, no photo flashes
            </li>
            <li>mild light that does not dazzle</li>
            <li>
              no booths of organizations like Digitalcourage (only booth:
              c3auti, with the Auti cards + information)
            </li>
            <li>
              no loud political demonstrations (e.g. Extinction Rebellion)
            </li>
            <li>no loud art (e.g. choir)</li>
            <li>
              conversations are allowed, but (bigger) workshops and meetings are
              not allowed
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With all the things not allowed, I should add that c3auti had
            workshops and meetings elsewhere.

          and it shows how autism is perceived by the aspects where it is
          problematic. Even after Greta Thunberg became so popular, autism is
          still described by the inadequacies and not by the talents. At least
          that was what I saw at the Camp at c3auti: being an emotional
          firefighter. And I saw very talented people at c3auti, autistics are
          quite wonderful in their own way. <br />
          Also, for buildup and teardown of things, kanban boards are superbe.
        </p>
        <p>
          They might not be aware of it, but neurotypical people get overwhelmed
          at congress too, particularly the more introverted ones. The QuietQube
          was supposed to be for everyone and it fit in beautifully. <br />
          We got feedback like 'Really this didn't exist before?! It is so
          obviously needed.' and 'Suddenly I'm not disabled anymore', which
          confirms my understanding of inclusion.
