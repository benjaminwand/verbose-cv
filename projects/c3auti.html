      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Disclaimer: I’m speaking from my perspective here, but let’s keep in
          mind that such group activities are always a group effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://help.ccc.de/c3auti/index.en.html">c3auti</a>
          is a volunteer organisation that cares for the needs of autistic
          people at events of the Chaos Computer Club. <br />
          When I first heard of it, I laughed, because: maybe a third of the
          people at Chaos events show autistic traits, and suddenly we need a
          committee for that? But it turns out we do need one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In August 2019
          <a href="https://twitter.com/fair_sein">fairsein</a> recruited me for
          c3auti for the
          <a href="https://events.ccc.de/camp/2019/wiki/Main_Page"
            >Chaos Communication Camp</a
          >, and as I was looking for a new team anyway, I joined. It was
          chaotic and enjoyable, and there were organisational challenges that
          spurned my ambition and my lust for improving organisational things.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>At Camp</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          During Camp I had my first experiences with helping autistics in
          stressful situations, which I previously had been unfamiliar with. My
          way of approaching this was treating them like people who got stuck on
          a bad trip in hypnosis, using simplified language and assuming them to
          have normal needs but being limited in language and rational thinking.
          Although I couldn’t find connection between hypnosis and autism (I
          searched!), I couldn’t find any, but practically that approach was
          successful, I got good feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other people who worked at c3auti had different approaches, this was
          interesting to see. We recognize it when we see it, but explaining how
          to care well for someone is hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the management side my contributions were little, like writing
          meeting protocols.
          <br />
          Until Camp 2019, one had to be autistic to have a leading role at
          c3auti and I found that problematic for two reasons: I think we should
          not force people to out themselves and diversity in a team is always
          good, it is good having neurotypical people in responsible roles too.
          I helped ease the way into having non-autistic people at c3auti.

      <h2>Congress and QuietQube</h2>

      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          When the
          <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"
            >36th Chaos Communication Congress</a
          >
          drew nearer, I became a team lead at c3auti. Things that were brought
          forward through me were doing the QuietQube, writing decent
          documentation, organizing things early enough and changing the
          staffing structure.
        </p>

        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>
          In short, I did my best to have good meeting protocolls and other
          written material, like a shift schedule, so future people who do
          c3auti at congress have something to start from and don't need to
          reinvent everyhing every year. I knew, and made public before
          congress, that I would't stay at c3auti forever, and so involving and
          teaching future activists was important.
        </p>

        <h3>Staffing</h3>
        <p>
          A troublesome aspect at camp was the team role 'coordinator', because
          it wasn't well defined what they have to coordinate at all, different
          people understood their job differently. If one would have done the
          sum of everyones opinion, that would have been superhuman. For
          Congress I ended up splitting the job in two: a management person who
          would moderate meetings, make sure everyone can work well and onboards
          new team members, and a specialist for emergencies (coordinating
          emergency missions). <br />
          I'd recommend that separation for events larger than 3000 people, at
          small events there just aren't enough qualified volunteers for both
          roles.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>The QuietQube</h2>
      <h3>Origin and conceptual thoughts</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          At Camp and at previous editions of c3auti there had been a room for
          c3auti, or two rooms, a generel one and a meltdown room. <br />
          At camp it became obvious rather quickly that we coudn't do daily team
          meetings in the general room because it was intended for people to
          relax. We ended up doing the team meetings outdoors, which was fine
          because the weather was great but it was obvious that at congress we
          would have to do the meeings in a room that was neither the meltdown
          room nor the general c3auti socializing area. We ended up getting a
          general purpose meeting room for the meetings at 36C3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing that bugged me was that on the one hand people at c3auti
          were encouraged to not ask for diagnosis but on the other hand the
          room was for autistics, therefore by using it one would out
          themselves. My aspiration for inclusion is high and I think that it is
          nessecary to ask for needs and not for diseases (whether or not one
          thinks of autism as a disiease or a disability.) Therefore, I found it
          important that a room that caters for the (socializing) needs of
          autistics should be described in a way that it caters for needs and
          not 'is for autistics'. <br />
          They might not be aware of it but neurotypical people get overwhelmed
          at congress too, particularly the more introverted ones. The QuietQube
          was supposed to be for everyone.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p class="draft">
          and it shows how autism is perceived by the aspects where it is
          problematic. Even after Greta Thunberg became so popular, autism is
          still described by the inadequacies and not by the talents. At least
          that was what I saw at the Camp at c3auti: being an emotional
          firefighter. And I saw very talented people at c3auti, autistics are
          quite wonderful in their own way.
