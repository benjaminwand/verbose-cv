      <h1>
        c3auti and QuietQube
      </h1>
      <p class="date">August - December 2019</p>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Disclaimer: I’m speaking from my perspective here, but let’s keep in
          mind that such group activities are always a group effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          c3auti is a volunteer organisation that cares for the needs of
          autistic people at events of the Chaos Computer Club. When I first
          heard of it, I laughed, because: maybe a third of the people at Chaos
          events show autistic traits, and suddenly we need a committee for
          that? But it turns out we do need one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In August 2019 fairsein recruited me for c3auti for the Chaos
          Communication Camp, and as I was looking for a new team anyway, I
          joined. It was chaotic and enjoyable, and there were organisational
          challenges that spurned my ambition and my lust for improving
          organisational things.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>At Camp</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          During Camp I had my first experiences with helping autistics in
          stressful situations, which I previously had been unfamiliar with. My
          way of approaching this was treating them like people who got stuck on
          a bad trip in hypnosis, using simplified language and assuming them to
          have normal needs but being limited in language and rational thinking.
          Although I couldn’t find connection between hypnosis and autism (I
          searched!), I couldn’t find any, but practically that approach was
          successful, I got good feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at it now, 1.5 years later, ’normal needs but stuck on a bad
          trip’ sounds a lot like I can understand needs of autistics very well
          (guess why). <br />
          Other people who worked at c3auti had different approaches, this was
          interesting to see. We recognize it when we see it, but explaining how
          to care well for someone is hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the management side my contributions were little, like writing
          meeting protocols.
          <br />
          Previously, one had to be autistic to have a leading role at c3auti
          and I found that problematic for two reasons: I think we should not
          force people to out themselves and diversity in a team is always good,
          it is good having neurotypical people in responsible roles too. I
          helped ease the way into having non-autistic people at c3auti.

      <h2>Congress and QuietQube</h2>

      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          When the Chaos Communication Congress drew nearer, I became a team
          lead at c3auti. Things that were brought forward through me were doing
          the QuietQube, writing decent documentation and organizing things
          early enough, and changing the staffing structure.
        </p>

        <h3>Staffing</h3>
        <p>
          A troublesome aspect at camp was a role 'coordinator', because it was
          unclear what they have to coordinate at all, different people
          understood their job differently. If one would have done the sum of
          everyones opinion, that would have been superhuman. For Congress I
          ended up splitting the job in two: a management person who would
          moderate meetings, make sure everyone can work well and onboards new
          team members, and a specialist for emergencies (coordinating emergency
          missions). <br />
          I'd recommend that separation for events larger than 3000 people,at
          small events there just aren't enough volunteers for it.
        </p>

        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>
          In short, I did my best to have good meeting protocolls and other
          written material, like a shift schedule, so future people who do
          c3auti at congress have something to start from and don't need to
          reinvent everyhing every year.
        </p>

        <h3>The QuietQube</h3>
        <p>Another thing I found disturbing at Camp was the overall</p>

          and it shows how autism is perceived by the aspects where it is
          problematic. Even after Greta Thunberg became so popular, autism is
          still described by the inadequacies and not by the talents. At least
          that was what I saw at the Camp at c3auti: being an emotional
          firefighter. And I saw very talented people at c3auti, autistics are
          quite wonderful in their own way.
