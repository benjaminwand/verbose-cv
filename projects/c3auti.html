      <h2>About</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Disclaimer: I’m speaking from my perspective here, but let’s keep in
          mind that such group activities are always a group effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://help.ccc.de/c3auti/index.en.html">c3auti</a>
          is a volunteer organisation that cares for the needs of autistic
          people at events of the Chaos Computer Club. <br />
          When I first heard of it, I laughed, because: maybe a third of the
          people at Chaos events show autistic traits, and suddenly we need a
          committee for that? But it turns out we do need one, we need it
          because as an institution c3auti can talk to other institutions and
          can for instance run the QuietQube.
        </p>
        <p>
          In August 2019
          <a href="https://twitter.com/fair_sein">fairsein</a> recruited me for
          c3auti for the
          <a href="https://events.ccc.de/camp/2019/wiki/Main_Page"
            >Chaos Communication Camp</a
          >, and as I was looking for a new team anyway, I joined. It was
          chaotic and enjoyable, and there were organisational challenges that
          spurned my ambition and my lust for improving organisational things.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>At Camp</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Previously I had been mostly unfamiliar with autism and during Camp I
          had my first experiences with helping autistics in stressful
          situations. My way of approaching this was treating them like people
          who got stuck on a bad trip in hypnosis, using simplified language and
          assuming them to have normal needs but being limited in language and
          rational thinking. Searching for connections between hypnosis and
          autism I couldn’t find any, but practically that approach was
          successful, I got good feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other people who worked at c3auti had different approaches, this was
          interesting to see. We recognize it when we see it, but explaining how
          to care for someone well is hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the management side my contributions were little, like writing
          meeting protocols.
          <br />
          Until Camp 2019, one had to be autistic to have a leading role at
          c3auti and I found that problematic for two reasons: I think we should
          not force people to out themselves and diversity in a team is always
          good, it is good having neurotypical people in responsible roles too.
          I helped ease the way into having non-autistics at c3auti.
        </p>

      <h2>Congress planning</h2>

      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          When the
          <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"
            >36th Chaos Communication Congress</a
          >
          drew nearer, I became a team lead at c3auti. Things that were brought
          forward through me were doing the
          <a
            href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/QuietQube"
          >
            QuietQube</a
          >, writing better documentation, organizing things early enough and
          changing the staffing structure.
        </p>

        <h4>Documentation</h4>
        <p>
          In short, I did my best to have good meeting protocols and other
          written material, like a shift schedule, so future people who do
          c3auti at congress have something to start from and don't need to
          reinvent everything every year. I knew, and made public before
          congress, that I won't stay at c3auti forever, and therefore making an
          effort to involve future activists was important.
        </p>
        <div class="inline-block">
          <h4>Staffing</h4>
          <p>
            A troublesome aspect at camp was the team role 'coordinator',
            because it wasn't well defined what they have to coordinate at all,
            different people understood their job differently. If one would have
            done the sum of everyones opinion, that would have been superhuman.
            For Congress I ended up splitting the job in two: a management
            person who would moderate meetings, make sure everyone can work well
            and onboards new team members, and a specialist for emergencies
            (coordinating emergency missions). <br />
            I'd recommend that separation for events larger than 3000 people, at
            small events there just aren't enough qualified volunteers for both
            roles.

      <h2>The QuietQube</h2>

      <h3>Origin of the concept: better inclusion</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Yes, my aspiration for inclusion is high, lets aim for 300% and
          achieve 150%.
          <br />
          A thing that bugged me at camp was the exclusionary nature of the
          c3auti infrastructure. On the one hand people at c3auti were
          encouraged not to ask for diagnosis but on the other hand the room was
          'for autistics', therefore using it required the awareness of ones own
          neurodivergence and would out oneself. Can't we have something like
          the hackcenter, a general hacking and socializing area, that works
          well for autistics, so they can participate in the congress equally
          well as neurotypical people and don't need the meltdown room as often?
          This is what the QuietQube was.
          <br />
          In order to not ask for diagnosis at all, the QuietQube was
          defined/described by rules instead of 'for autistics'.
        </p>
        <p>
          We declared the rules as following:
        </p>
        <ul class="ch65">
          <li>no music</li>
          <li>
            blinking has to be limited to the most necessary, no photo flashes
          </li>
          <li>mild light that does not dazzle</li>
          <li>
            no booths of organizations like Digitalcourage (only booth: c3auti,
            with the Auti cards + information)
          </li>
          <li>
            no loud political demonstrations (e.g. Extinction Rebellion)
          </li>
          <li>no loud art (e.g. choir)</li>
          <li>
            conversations are allowed, but (bigger) workshops and meetings are
            not allowed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <h3>Planning and build-up</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          As the location, we got a cube-shaped restaurant, hence the name.
          <br />
          Fun fact: in order to discuss with
          <a href="https://twitter.com/fhainalex/">Fhainalex</a> what is going
          to be where, I made a QuietQube doll's house.

          We got great support from the <a href="https://c3loc.de">c3LOC</a>,
          and so c3auti could run such a large place at congress for the first
          time, with mostly first-time team leads.

          This paragraph is still in draft-state, hopefully to be finished
          during March 2021.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Words and concepts are not my greatest talent and not everyone could
          imagine before 36c3 what the QuietQube would be like. But when they
          saw it things fell in place and now one would rather have to justify
          not making it again than making it again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the environment was problem-free-er than congress usually is, it
          made neurodivergent people problem-free-er and we could get to know
          each other better in our strengths than in our inadequacies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from not needing to out one-self another burden was taken away
          from the people who used the QuietQube: the necessity to explain
          special needs, which people in marginalised groups generally have, and
          which is one of the big problems of belonging to a marginalised group.
        </p>
        <p>
          They might not be aware of it, but neurotypical people get overwhelmed
          at congress too, particularly the more introverted ones. The QuietQube
          was supposed to be for everyone who appreciate the rules we had, and
          it certainly was appreciated by non-autistics too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people at 36c3 expressed need for a library-like no-talk area and
          mistook the QuietQube for it and were unhappy with people having
          conversations. Oh well, they might want to form a Library Operation
          Center.
        </p>
        <p>
          We got feedback like 'Really this didn't exist before?! It is so
          obviously needed.' and 'Suddenly I'm not disabled anymore', which
          confirms my understanding of inclusion. In short: the inclusion
          concept was successful.
