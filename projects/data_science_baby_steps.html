      <h2>Motivation: well functioning curves in OpenSCAD</h2>

      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          In the sometimes slow OpenSCAD one has to be mindful of computing
          power and I had been unhappy with the approximation of the length of
          the curve in
          <a href="bezier_curves.html">my Bézier curve code</a> since it
          existed. Ideally I would like to have an f(x) shaped way to calculate
          the approximation but the recursive nature of Bézier curves is
          persistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          ChatGPT makes coding so easy now that I could approach it with
          data-scienc-y methods, making it the first project where I analyze
          data in a Jupyter notebook in a self-directed manner. I made 1000
          cubic Bézier curves based on random numbers and looked at the sums of
          lengths of the approximations of three, four and five points compared
          to the actual lengths. They gave me, on average, 1.14, 1.05 and 1.03
          times too short lengths, with the dispersion being worse for less
          points too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I looked at the edge cases (very long and very short
          approximations) and decided that they aren’t worth the hassle because
          they look weird and are unlikely to actually appear in a design
          project. Therefore I am happy with estimating the length of the Bézier
          curves by calculating a approximation of four points and summing up
          the distances between them.

            >The file with the calculations is here.
          </a>
          If you judge my skill keep in mind that most of the code is written by
          ChatGPT.

      <h2>Future</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          I might do it again and throw thoughts, ChatGPT and Jupyter onto
          finding a f(x) shaped method after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I have to implement it into my Bézier curve code to make actual
          use of it.

            Ten curves to make plausible what I mean with weird looking edge
            cases. Also, it looks nice.
