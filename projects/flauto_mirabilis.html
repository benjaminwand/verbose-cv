        360째 labial pipe / Flauto mirabilis
      </h1>
      <p class="date">February - April 2020</p>
      <h2>An incoming request</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          After not working on organ pipes since June 2019, I got a request from
          thingiverse, which made me research and write organ related code
          again, about labial pipes that have a 360째 labium. All the information
          is in the videos, therefore who likes text can read the text and who
          likes to watch me talk can watch me talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as I know, there are two companies who made such pipes so far.
          <a href="https://www.orgelbau.ch/de/">Kuhn</a> calls them
          <a href="https://www.orgelbau.ch/de/innovation-d.html"
            >'Flauto mirabilis'</a
          >
          and builds them since 2003, and
          <a href="http://www.hey-orgelbau.de">Hey</a> built one instrument
          named 'Vox Maris' in 2012,
          <a
            href="https://www.hey-orgelbau.de/projekte/orgelneubau/vox_maris.html"
            >here is the description on their own webpage</a
          >
          and it was described
          <a
            href="https://docplayer.org/44465256-L-action-reciproque-de-l-anche-et.html"
            >in ISO 43</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like I always did it when making labial pipes, I decided to use
          plastic pipes and only 3d-print the intricate part.
          <a
            href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/3d-printed-labial-pipe/blob/master/0.22.0%20flauto%20mirabilis%20(Kuhn).scad"
            >0.22</a
          >
          was the first file I made. It sounded surprizingly well but it was a
          little bit finicky to print and I found that the upcut influences the
          sound a lot and it was impossible to make that fixed without glueing
          the pipe together, which I didn't want to since I had suddenly found
          joy in intonation.
        </p>

        <p>
          To fix those limitations, I wrote
          <a
            href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/3d-printed-labial-pipe/blob/master/0.23.0.scad"
            >0.23</a
          >, where the upcut can be adjusted with a screw, you can see it in the
          image.
        </p>

        <img
          class="scaled"
          src="../img/360_degree_labial_pipe.jpg"
          alt="3d-printed labial pipe with 360째 labium"
        />
        <p>
          Those two models worked well given that the tube has an edge which
          functions as a labium. Since this isn't always given, I wrote
          <a
            href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/3d-printed-labial-pipe/blob/master/0.24.0.scad"
            >0.24</a
          >, where the labium is printed as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things I found:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The slit has to be thin, figure out what your 3d-printer can do. If
            it is too wide, you'll get no sound at all.
          </li>
          <li>The upcut has to be low.</li>
          <li>
            The pitch doesn't vary much with different air pressure, much less
            than what I knew from normal labial pipes. I was specifically
            looking for that because I knew that the Vox Maris has dynamic
            abilities.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Being an outdoor organ, the Vox Maris has to be loud, and also Kuhn
          builds the Flauto mirabilis as high pressure stops.
