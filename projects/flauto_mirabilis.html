        360° labial pipe

        <p>
          After not working on organ pipes since June 2019, I got a request from
          thingiverse, which made me research and write organ related code
          again, about labial pipes that have a 360° labium. All the information
          is in the videos, therefore who likes text can read the text and who
          likes to watch me talk can watch me talk.

        <p>
          As far as I know, there are two companies who made such pipes so far.
          <a href="https://www.orgelbau.ch/de/">Kuhn</a> calls them
          <a href="https://www.orgelbau.ch/de/innovation-d.html"
            >'Flauto mirabilis'</a
          >
          and builds them since 2003, and
          <a href="http://www.hey-orgelbau.de">Hey</a> built one instrument
          named 'Vox Maris' in 2012,
          <a
            href="https://www.hey-orgelbau.de/projekte/orgelneubau/vox_maris.html"
            >here is the description on their own webpage</a
          >
          and it was described
          <a
            href="https://docplayer.org/44465256-L-action-reciproque-de-l-anche-et.html"
            >in ISO 43</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like I always did it when making labial pipes, I decided to use
          plastic pipes and only 3d-print the intricate part.
          <a
            href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/3d-printed-labial-pipe/blob/master/0.22.0%20flauto%20mirabilis%20(Kuhn).scad"
            >0.22</a
          >
          was the first file I made. It sounded surprisingly well but it was a
          little bit finicky to print and I found that the Cut-up influences the
          sound a lot and it was impossible to make that fixed without glueing
          the pipe together, which I didn't like to do since I had suddenly
          found joy in intonation.
        </p>

        <p>
          To fix those limitations, I wrote
          <a
            href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/3d-printed-labial-pipe/blob/master/0.23.0.scad"
            >0.23</a
          >, where the Cut-up can be adjusted with a screw, you can see it in
          the image.
        </p>

        <img
          class="scaled"
          src="../img/360_degree_labial_pipe.jpg"
          alt="3d-printed labial pipe with 360° labium"
        />
        <p>
          Those two models worked well but require that the pipe has an edge
          which functions as a labium. Since this isn't always given, I wrote
          <a
            href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/3d-printed-labial-pipe/blob/master/0.24.0.scad"
            >0.24</a
          >, where the labium is printed as well. Unfortunately it didn't sound
          as well, which possibly is an issue of nozzle size, 0.4mm might be too
          thick for such small pipes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things I found:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The slit has to be thin, figure out what your 3d-printer can do. If
            it is too wide, you won't get sound at all.
          </li>
          <li>The Cut-up has to be low-ish.</li>
          <li>
            The pitch doesn't vary much with different air pressure, much less
            than what I knew from normal labial pipes. I was looking for that
            because I knew that the Vox Maris has dynamic abilities, and it is
            interesting for my currently inactive project of working on organs
            with dynamics that is informed by pressure (and not by speed, which
            is what you get with current MIDI-keyboards).
          </li>
          <li>
            Pipes with a 360° labium are candidates for high pressure (this got
            confirmed by Kuhn, and the Vox Maris obviously is high pressure too,
            it works with pneumatic tech).
          </li>
        </ul>
