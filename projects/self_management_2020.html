        Working on productivity ... again
      </h1>

      <p class="date">April/May 2020</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>

      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          My school career recommendation by the end of primary school said that
          I was very creative and interested in almost everything, have
          difficulties following goals, and have to learn to organise myself
          better.<br />
          And one of the things that happened a few years later was that I made
          my problem into a hobby and developed an interest for management,
          partly as a new interest and partly as a survival strategy, because
          I'm still creative and interested in many things, and have to be well
          organized in order to do many of those.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 'making it into a hobby' I mean that I read books about management
          (and self-management) for enjoyment. I'm a certified ScrumMaster and
          am considering studying human resources management because it would
          actually interest me. Also as an activity, management is a typical
          thing I do. When a hobbyist group forms around me, I often end up
          being involved in the planning. I like it and things work better when
          I help organize.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something in me likes order, for instance I have
          <a href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/library-shelf-markers"
            >self-designed and 3d-printed book shelf signs</a
          >, but I'm also a chaos person and the structures I build for myself
          need to be robust to acomodate for a daydreamer. <br />
          A main challenge for me is having too many projects and things on my
          mind, and in order to be productive I need to focus on singletasking,
          practically and mentally. In institutionalized education we are taught
          that we need to remember things and otherwise we are worthless. I
          think this is harmful, writing good protocols and routinely setting
          oneself timers and calendar items is better than trying to remember
          things.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Some things I've tried (sucessfully)</h2>
      <h3>Important principle: single source of truth</h3>
      <p class="columns">
        Different media (calendar, board, todo-app ...) have their advantages
        but I think it is very important having one main document that 'is
        right'. At programming this is often called 'single source of truth'.
        Throughout the years I've been going back and forth between propritizing
        either a calendar, a (kanban? not exactly.) board or lists of various
        sorts. However, it is important to know which one is the main document
        at a given point.
      </p>

      <h3>Creative writing</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Calling creative writing a productivity tool might sound strange at
          first but the amazing thing about it is that it makes my subconsious
          speak and brings out the dreamer-aspects and actual problems that
          would otherwise block my productivity. (And once In know them I can
          decide to ignore it or solve problems.) Also the self-awareness that
          creative writing brings, helps me be grateful about my thoughts,
          feelings and actions and makes me more happy in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started creatice writing in 2015 with the book
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way"
            >The Artist's Way</a
          >, which contains a lot of hard to bear esoteric bullshit but the
          instruction for writing were very helpful to me. It is called 'morning
          pages' and in the beginning one is supposed to write three pages each
          morning. This is great to develop a habit and meanwhile I write when
          ever I feel like it and it isn't nessecarily three pages but I'm done
          when I spit it out, what ever it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, free writing is part of a planning process. Look at the
          image, the first third of the left page is the end of the morning
          pages that day, then I did a little bit of random planning and then
          (lowest third of the left page) I started the outline for this
          article. The writing helps me to tidy up my mind, which is very
          helpful before or while doing conceptual things. Often tasks come up
          during writing, and then I use a marker or different color to continue
          writing and find the task back later.
        </p>

      <h3>Bullet Journal</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          <a href="https://bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a> can be
          described as a todo-app as a book. By the time I was starting to use
          it (in 2016), I was already enjoying writing with fountain pens, which
          made the whole 'book instead of app' thing very inviting. It turned
          out immediately though that I had to adapt the protocol and use a
          computer calendar instead of the calendar in the book, because I
          reschedule things often and on a hand-written medium that creates a
          mess, and digital calendars have the advantages that links and
          attachments can be added to calendar entries, which is very practical
          when doing various digital activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often (but not daily) I make myself a task list for the day ('Day
          Log') but a much more important learning from bullet journal is using
          notebooks with enumerated pages and an index. That helps writing
          things 'into the chaos' and still find things back.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h3>Paper is for early stages</h3>

      <p class="columns">
        For many years I considered the computer science course I had at
        highschool to be worthless. What did we learn? Formatting Word documents
        and some Turbo Pascal, none of which did anything useful and all of
        which I have forgotten by now. But when I started writing
        <a href="https://www.openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a> code in 2018, I noticed
        that we've actually learnt something useful at computer science: writing
        pseudocode. Sketching is done best by hand on paper, and sketches can be
        pseudocode, outlines (for for articles or letters) or drawings (for CAD
        files). Figuring out the big image, the outline, for something, works
        best hand written, at least for me. And since I, as a prototyper and
        eternal learner, am at home with early stages, I use paper a lot.
      </p>
      <h3>Digital is for elaboration and version control</h3>

      <section class="columns">

      <h2>Other productivity related things I've learnt recently</h2>
      <p class="columns">
        I'm more fluent at text-to-speech than I previously had been aware of.
        It is not only that I know the keyboard-shortcut on my computer but I
        also use text-to-speech without even thinking about it, and a computer
        that doesn't have text-to-speech accessible through kexboard shortcuts
        is very unappealing to me, which might be another reason why I'm not
        interested in using a smart phone or tablet.
