      <p class="description">
        Schullaufbahnempfehlung <br />
        Management-Nerdtum <br />
        certified ScrumMaster <br />
        something in me likes order <br />
        also: something in me loves to operate with subconscious much -> <br />
        important principle: do order when I have the brains for it so I can
        also be a dreamer much of the time
      </p>

      <h2 class="indie_flower">Some things I've tried (sucessfully)</h2>
      <h3 class="indie_flower">Important principle: single source of truth</h3>
      <p class="description">
        I always want a single source of truth because manually syncing between
        various media is an extra task that I'm not willing to do permanently.
        Throughout the years I've been going back and forth between propritizing
        either a calendar, a (kanban? not exactly.) board or lists of various
        sorts. Despite the advantages they all have, having single source of
        truth matters more, I'm sure I need a 'primary' medium.
      </p>
      <h3 class="indie_flower">Bullet Journal</h3>
      <p class="description">
        One thing I want to point out is the
        <a href="https://bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a>, which can be
        described as a todo-app as a book. By the time I was starting to use it
        (2016), I was already enjoying writing with fountain pens, which made
        the whole 'book instead of app' thing very inviting. It turned out
        immediately though that I had to adapt the protocol and use a computer
        calendar instead having the calendar in the book because I reschedule
        things too often and on a hand-written medium that is a mess and nit as
        prettily as I want my founten-pen-things to be like.<br />
        Important learning: use notebook with enumerated pages and an index. It
        helps writing things 'into the chaos' and still find them back. I find
        that handwritten media are particularly good when working on drafts of
        all sorts, for instance pseudo code and forst versions of technical
        drawings. This is great for me as a prototyper and therefore I use
        handwritten media (almost) daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        therefore ar any given point there had to be <br />
        All means bring the question how detailled to plan when, and calendars
        bring the question how many things to calendar, but how many things
        should one schedule? <br />

      <h2 class="indie_flower">Other things I've learnt recently</h2>
      <p class="description">
        I'm super fluent at text-to-speech. It is not only that I know the
        keyboard-shortcuts but I also use text-to-speech without thinking and a
        computer that doesn't have it is basically broken for me, which is
        possibly another reason why I'm not interested in using a smart phone or
        tablet. (Yes, I know texnically it is possible to use text-to-speech on
        handheld devices but then there aren't keyboard shortcuts and it is
        annoying highlighting specific parts of thexts, the ones I want to hear,
        on a touch display.)
