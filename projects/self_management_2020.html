        Working on productivity ... again
      </h1>

      <p class="date">April/May 2020</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>

      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          My school career recommendation by the end of primary school said that
          I was very creative and interested in almost everything, have
          difficulties following goals, and have to learn to organize myself
          better.<br />
          And one of the things that happened a few years later was that I made
          my problem into a hobby and developed an interest for management,
          partly as a new interest and partly as a survival strategy, because
          I'm still creative and interested in many things, and have to be well
          organized in order to do many of those.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 'making it into a hobby' I mean that I read books about management
          (and self-management) for enjoyment. I'm a certified ScrumMaster and
          am considering studying human resources management because it would
          actually interest me. Also as an activity, management is a typical
          thing I do. When a hobbyist group forms around me, I often end up
          being involved in the planning. I like it and things work better when
          I help organize.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something in me likes order, for instance I have
          <a href="https://github.com/benjaminwand/library-shelf-markers"
            >self-designed and 3d-printed book shelf signs</a
          >, but I'm also a chaos person and the structures I build for myself
          need to be robust to accommodate for a daydreamer. <br />
          A main challenge for me is having too many projects and things on my
          mind, and in order to be productive I need to focus on single-tasking,
          practically and mentally. In institutionalized education we are taught
          that we need to remember things and otherwise we are worthless. I
          think this is harmful, writing good protocols and routinely setting
          oneself timers and calendar items is better than trying to remember
          things.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Some things I've tried (successfully)</h2>
      <h3>Important principle: single source of truth</h3>
      <p class="columns">
        Different media (calendar, board, todo-app ...) have their advantages
        but I think it is very important having one main document that 'is
        right'. At programming this is often called 'single source of truth'.
        Throughout the years I've been going back and forth between prioritizing
        either a calendar, a (kanban? not exactly.) board or lists of various
        sorts. However, it is important to know which one is the main document
        at a given point.
      </p>

      <h3>Creative writing</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Calling creative writing a productivity tool might sound strange at
          first but the amazing thing about it is that it makes my subconscious
          speak and brings out the dreamer-aspects and actual problems that
          would otherwise block my productivity. (And once In know them I can
          decide to ignore it or solve problems.) Also the self-awareness that
          creative writing brings, helps me be grateful about my thoughts,
          feelings and actions and makes me more happy in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started creative writing in 2015 with the book
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way"
            >The Artist's Way</a
          >, which contains a lot of hard to bear esoteric bullshit but the
          instruction for writing were very helpful to me. It is called 'morning
          pages' and in the beginning one is supposed to write three pages each
          morning. This is great to develop a habit and meanwhile I write when
          ever I feel like it and it isn't necessarily three pages but I'm done
          when I spit it out, what ever it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, free writing is part of a planning process. Look at the
          image, the first third of the left page is the end of the morning
          pages that day, then I did a little bit of random planning and then
          (lowest third of the left page) I started the outline for this
          article. The writing helps me to tidy up my mind, which is very
          helpful before or while doing conceptual things. Often tasks come up
          during writing, and then I use a marker or different color to continue
          writing and find the task back later.
        </p>

      </section>

      <h3>Bullet Journal</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          <a href="https://bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a> can be
          described as a todo-app as a book. By the time I was starting to use
          it (in 2016), I was already enjoying writing with fountain pens, which
          made the whole 'book instead of app' thing very inviting. It turned
          out immediately though that I had to adapt the protocol and use a
          computer calendar instead of the calendar in the book, because I
          reschedule things often and on a hand-written medium that creates a
          mess, and digital calendars have the advantages that links and
          attachments can be added to calendar entries, which is very practical
          when doing various digital activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often (but not daily) I make myself a task list for the day ('Day
          Log') but a much more important learning from bullet journal is using
          notebooks with enumerated pages and an index. That helps writing
          things 'into the chaos' and still find things back.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h3>Analog is for early stages</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          For many years I considered the computer science course I had at
          high-school to be worthless (we learnt formatting Word documents and
          some Turbo Pascal). But when I started writing
          <a href="https://www.openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a> code in 2018, I
          noticed that I've actually learnt something very useful at computer
          science: writing pseudocode by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the beginning of a thing, when main aspects about it are still
          unclear, one might consider it to be analog. Digital means that the
          thing being measured and expressed with numbers and categories is
          already built-in, which is not the case for what I call analog here,
          where categories and measures can still be invented, negotiated,
          found. At a beginning, the field is open, the page is blank, and so it
          is great starting with pen and paper, where no categories need to be
          picked before starting. <br />
          (Further explanation: a category would mean picking a specific app to
          work in, a framework or a programming language. There is no blank page
          software, one can only reasonably work with software when one already
          knows whether it is going to be a novel or a painting.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I, as a prototyper and eternal learner, am at home at early
          stages, I use pen and paper a lot.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h3>Digital is for elaboration and version control</h3>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          Refining works best in increments. As soon as a brain child has an
          overall shape and a set of main ideas, it is time to move to a medium
          where changes can be applied many times and where there is an
          'undo'-button and version control. (Obviously that is impossible for
          most works of analog craft like woodwork or blacksmithing, but this
          article is about self-management and not about woodworking.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Those thoughts about early stages and refinement are influenced by
          <a href="https://www.creaffective.de/produkt/denkwerkzeuge/"
            >a book about creative techniques</a
          >, where a main idea was that techniques are either 'divergent',
          opening, brainstorming, allowing everything, or 'convergent',
          collecting, judging, categorizing. And even if I didn't learn many
          concrete techniques from the book, deliberately using divergent and
          convergent strategies at the right points in time stuck with me, and
          deliberately using paper and digital media has a lot to do with that.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h3>The board</h3>
      <p class="columns">
        Guess what, as an agile person I put stickies on walls. Kanban boards
        are great for group projects but as a private person I use a board
        differently. It is home to non-urgent and non-actionable tasks, to 'at
        some point in the future', to dreams. <br />
        And my board has a special category: 'I need help with that'. When I'm
        stuck with something, I put a stickie in the 'I need help with that'
        row, which normalises asking for help and keeps me from forgetting it,
        especially when it is non-actionable for instance when I don't have a
        concrete person to ask in that case.
      </p>

      <h2>Current System</h2>
      <section class="columns">
        <p>
          My current way to organize my things is motivated by facilitating
          single-tasking by making it super lightweight to create tasks for
          later. I don't try to remember things, if I forget something it
          probably wasn't important. Usually I have my laptop with me, and then
          I write it directly into my calendar, and otherwise I write it into my
          bullet journal or what ever I have around. If I write it onto a random
          piece of paper, I have a place in my bag where I know it won't get
          lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strongly avoid doing things that unnecessarily drain me. There is no
          shame in getting help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing morning pages is something I don't do every day but I have to
          do it at least three times a week in order to be happy-ish and
          productive.
        </p>
        <p>
          On days with many smaller tasks I make a list (day log) in the
          morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually I schedule tasks for four hours a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In about two thirds of the days I actually do all the things from the
          day log.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do schedule sports and maintenance/cleaning tasks as well. For
          instance I wouldn’t clean my windows in years if it wouldn’t appear in
          my calendar at some point because otherwise there would always be more
          important things
        </p>
      </section>

      <h3 class="hidden">What are the tasks</h3>
      <ul class="draft hidden">
        <li>coding</li>
        <li>research</li>
        <li>maintanance/cleaning</li>

        <li>sports</li>
        <li>meetings/ things with other people</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pros and cons</h3>
      <div class="fake-table">
        <div class="onerow">
          <h4>Pros</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is a (for me) very easy to follow system.
            </li>
            <li>
              It doesn't have a lot of overhead like grooming task lists and
              re-evaluating importance. That means I spend most of the time with
              what I actually wanted to to instead of office games.
            </li>
            <li>
              Important but non-urgent tasks get done. (This is a goal in
              management in general, getting to a point where one isn't driven
              by urgent things but by important things.)
            </li>
            <li>
              It makes it easy to say no to peoples unreasonable requests, since
              I have an obviously full calendar. ('Shall I create a task for
              that in a month?')
            </li>
            <li>Writing morning pages gives me joy and gratitude.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="onerow">
          <h4>Cons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The task list is long, currently my calendar is booked for five
              weeks, and I prefer a planning horizon of two to three weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
              The tasks end up in an unconnected order.
            </li>
            <li>
              By the point I find a task in my todays list, it often is not
              actionable and then it takes longer or needs to be re-scheduled.
            </li>
            <li>
              That my calendar is always booked for the soon future makes it
              complicated to dive deep into a new thing right now when it is
              shiny and exciting. In that case I need to decide whether I want
              to move around a couple of calendar items or whether the new shiny
              thing has to wait for a bit.
            </li>

      <h2>Other productivity related things I've learnt recently</h2>
      <p class="columns">
        I'm more fluent at text-to-speech than I previously had been aware of.
        It is not only that I know the keyboard-shortcut on my computer but I
        also use text-to-speech without even thinking about it, and a computer
        that doesn't have text-to-speech accessible through keyboard shortcuts
        is very unappealing to me, which might be another reason why I'm not
        interested in using a smart phone or tablet.
